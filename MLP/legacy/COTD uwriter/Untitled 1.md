And you, my sinews, grow not instant old
But bear me swiftly up. Remember thee?
Ay, thou poor ghost, whiles memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee?

A dimmed darkness
Regal moon and summer sun

Wayward child, and promised prince
A ruler, who embraced his despair

Crescentic shadow finds it's twin

Rebellous spirits collide over unchanging fate

But lo', the hand that guids them
is a benevolent master


The weak breeze whispers nothing
The water screams sublime
His feet shift, teeter-totter
Deep breath, stand back, it’s time

Toes untouch the overpass
Soon he’s water bound
Eyes locked shut but peek to see
The view from halfway down

A little wind, a summer sun
A river rich and regal
A flood of fond endorphins
Brings a calm that knows no equal

You’re flying now
You see things much more clear than from the ground
It’s all okay, it would be
Were you not now halfway down

Thrash to break from gravity
What now could slow the drop
All I’d give for toes to touch
The safety back at top

But this is it, the deed is done
Silence drowns the sound
Before I leaped I should’ve seen
The view from halfway down

I really should’ve thought about
The view from halfway down
I wish I could’ve known about
The view from halfway down

When the light is running low
And the shadows start to grow
And the places that you know
Seem like fantasy
There's a light inside your soul
That’s still shining in the cold
With the truth
The promise in our hearts

Don't forget
I'm with you in the dark

He broke the tether; he's confound.
Forevermore, they are still bound.
All that he mustered was in vain
In dimmed darkness, there's a chain

A regal moon in night shines bright
Her purposes affront his sight
A summer sun rose high, glared down
Her fate entwined, she wears the gown


All not for naught, he isn't swayed
In frozen cold there's a shade
Despair and promise—there's the deal
A wayward child completes the seal
