"I can honestly say, I never missed the primitive charm of Arroyo more, until this very moment."

Yeah because he is the REAL bad guy. When he is out ruining everyone's life, that includes his own too.


Princess Cadance: I am recently widowed.
King Sombra: I am **dark**, tall, brooding, and handsome.
Princess Cadance: I can fix him.
King Sombra: I manipulate and kill your friends indiscriminately.
Princess Cadance: ...
Princess Cadance: Still, I can *try* to fix him.
King Sombra: I seem not to be even a living unicorn anymore, just pure darkness.
Princess Cadance: There is still hope! You **do** remember how you were alive, right?
King Sombra: You know, you're right! Life might be worth living. But I won't deal with my problems, so I'll just breed you now, and my child will do that instead of me. Living creatures do that, right?
Princess Cadance: Why every time I try to do something good, it blows in my face? You know what!? I'm bucking done with you all. 
Princess Cadance shows middle fingers with her wings, and gtfo's from the scene

All cast is looking astonished.


Princess Luna: So, you're with Wicked Mare now, huh.
Princess Celestia: Yep.
Princess Luna: You know she kills fillies, right?
Princess Celestia: Uh-huh.
Princess Luna: ...And not just fillies, she literally killed **thousands** before.
Princess Celestia: Yeah.
Princess Luna: She is a monster! She doesn't even deny that!
Princess Celestia: True.
Princess Luna: SHE IS RUNNING OUR KINGDOM! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
Princess Celestia: I can fix her.
Princess Luna: U sure?
Princess Celestia: Actually no, I do not want to fix her. I just think that is hot, and I can work with it.
Princess Luna: Cool.
Princess Celestia: Look, you deal with cards you've got, OK? Who knew that I can actually relate to her? And it's not like I can kill her either.
Shining Armor: Let me do that for you.
Princess Celestia: Thaâ€” wait, NO
Shining Armor: Too late! I'm already in your castle, sticking in your wife the mcguffin of Harmony!
Wicked Mare: Gee, that tickles!
