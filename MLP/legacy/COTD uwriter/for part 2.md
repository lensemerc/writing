Lady Snake
raise glazed eyes
time to awake
lonely shuddering skies
no one is around
in this small town
O' Sweet seductress
under stress
fiercely
slithering
unearthly
dithering
perversely
towards the stage
of beautiful rage
O' lovely writhe
Breathe....... Breathe
she blithely replied
I will lead you
to thee other side
through and through
a spiraling trance
hold my hands
with A soft kiss to yield
in radiant strawberry fields
dancing with sweet delight
below pale moon light

The Dark 
stirred awake
ambitions colliding
deathly mistake—
their fates are entwining
armies marched
tyrant looked forth
on plateau they crashed
Light prevailed, thenceforth—


North succumbed, but 

stage
rage
writhe
breathe


dark is colliding
