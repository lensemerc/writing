Celestia vs Chrysals. Говорят на следующий день после Свадьбы




"Entropy?" Queen snorts, her eyes glistening with green, "How quaint." 

В тронной зале.

22:29]Flovv Krovv: I am a Princess, you creature. I demand your respect.

"You're a glutton. All you know that how to devour, never to create."
"You do not know even a HALF of that..."
Celestia could tell that her words hurt Chrysalis, and it was just **amusing** to see. She really enjoyed this banter, this flirtation with danger. She didn't get to let loose and speak like that to anyone in millennia, and whole unabashed Chrysalis' persona was just invited to test out how far she could be pressed.  
"Please, creature of the dark, *enlighten* me," chuckle, "What you ever even build with those ragged hooves of yours?"
"Well, these **ragged** hooves of mine brought me your whole Equestria, didn't they?" arrogantly scoffed the Queen, "Why don't we call that a start?"
"A start of what?"
"Of demonstration." 

"Of demonstation..." echoed Celestia, looking from her throne...
"I have a demonstration of my own, Chrysalis."

Пони: Leave us.

Поджаривает её.



Huh... Hmm... Now i realise, while you ever needed that little lavender pony to follow you around! Very **clever**, Celestia. Not just because you needed an apprentice, or even a progeny - if need arises, you would **spawn** one **old-fashioned** way. It was because you wanted to find a compromise to change the world, not dictating how it should feel, but letting a generation to adapt and strife through kindness, and find their own way. Oh, i can see how these idealistic notions would've blossom into something spectacular...
*She laughs cruelly, compelled by these thoughts*
Too bad it would've never worked out.

So you've felt too old to risk it, and decided to play it safe? For somepony else to propagade this kindness? 

Разговор с you want them to suffer?


14:07]Flovv Krovv: She had a destiny, a cosmic purpose. She was wielding most important Element, until they got broken. I thought that she would truly unite world of logic and world of magic, and in this act, she would usher in age of new, better Equestria. Bind all different species through friendship, so we could coexist, flourish, cease all conflict, and spread Harmony. 
Friendship? Hah! I do not understand Friendship, but "magic", opposing "logic"?.... she laughed My dear Princess... How can you be so perfect, yet so foolish?
It's not about me. It's about this world she frowned in response It's about what is best for it— what i thought, what is best for it...
No, that's not what i meant. It's an archaic view. 
How is it archaic? Celestia responded, feeling as if she almost hears the rustling of Tree of Antiquity
Because... Chrysalis' voice dropped almost to a whisper, as she leaned to alicorn There is nothing illogical about magic. There never were. So there is no needed solution to a problem, never raised in a first place. Everyone who even starts to consider that magic and logic are exclusive to each other — moronic fools.
Celestia's eyes widened
...How can you speak like that? I fear it is you who is a fool, my Queen.
Why is it so? Things that we learned first, were never wrong. It's a lie by those who tried to teach us after that. Listen... Love is Power, Celestia... she looked at Princess patiently, as if she were talking to a filly, not to immortal and seemingly illogical demigod of the Sun And Change is Power... Fear is Power... Destiny is Power... Knowledge is Power... And Friendship, seems to be, Power too... Even Harmony is Power... Everything is talking to me in language of Power, Celestia. Step into my horseshoes for a minute. Don't you understand it now?
If everything is... constants and variables... Celestia frowned, following the changeling's line of thinking A pallette of emptiness and fullness... An opened mind surely can find a balance? 
[14:57]Flovv Krovv: No! Stop trying to rationalise this too much. You've lived too long, Celestia. Feel. You know what i'm talking about, it always was at the back of your mind, wasn't it? Everything and everyone is about POWER, or a measurement of POWER. No one can exist without it. And that means that logic and magic both are approaches, gradients if you will, of an ability of wielding POWER.
Celestia looked at the world of magical equines from the breach, caressing her temple
Maybe. she answered discontentedly Or maybe not. Ponies need hopes and ideas, examples to inspire them, not just beliefs and wonders. At least, there certainly more ways to progress, than one... I don't support fully what you are proposing. You seem to be bent on destruction more then on creating something new. Believe me, i've seen enough villains to know where this is going.
Chrysalis chuckles Well, i'd ask you to embrace this and get along on the ride, my pet. After all, we are bound, you've said so yourself.
You want them to fear... You want to invite dishonesty and unkindness in hearts of ponies she says, musing about it, still looking at world at large No, that's not the right word... Not "invite", let them embrace it, yes...
What better feel is there, but to embrace your fear and become a master of it?... Dark magic is familiar to you, Celestia. You know that this is right, and this is what your pupil Twilight would've allow to happen, sooner or later. And that is why, i ask you... she whispered to her ear Face the change yourself, not delegate to others. Let me be at your side. Be POWERFUL. And i will love you forever. With every last ounce of my dark soul. 
[15:40]Flovv Krovv: You want to break Harmony responds Celestia, closing her eyes. Sudden temptation holds her heart. Desire for something new... She doesn't believe that it's Chrysalis of all ponies, who speaks to her like this. But who else would've? Maybe she, as another ruler, can understand her and what she need
My dearest spouse, have you ever been outside borders of Equestria? scoffs Chrysalis I can't break something that never really existed.
Celestia gives her a weak look, a side glance, and closes eyes again. Why evil is always so seductive? This isn't right.
Well, I had been there the Changeling Queen continues to speak Hear me now... In you, in feeling that you wake inside me, i see a possibility that WE can make this world better. WE can do what you never could alone. Not to say, that this little safe haven of yours, full of love, is too susceptible... I will make it stronger. Our love will.
Why would you want to make the world, let alone Equestria, better? responds Celestia, looking straight in eyes of Chrysalis
The Changeling Queen eyes glimmer with green, as she is covered in darkness. She slightly squints
You love this world, and you are precious to me. You've given me more than i could ever dreamed of. That is why.

Why would i believe you? Celestia almost whispers You are a tyrant. You always wanted to control. You've forced your people to steal love, to fester in this world.

I've never been so powerful, like i am with you. Besides... she chuckles I am Queen of Equestria. I am not who i were just recently, anymore. And while i would love to ruin your little kingdom, and feed on it for generations to come, there really are nothing new in this, isn't there? Yes, i can see it clearly... I'm tired of feeding on scraps, while there are so delicious meal in front of me... It would be like to squander and spill it all. If i want to keep receiving your love and being powerful, i'm not afraid to put in it some work. It will be glorious... 
[16:29]Flovv Krovv: You aren't Chrysalis that i know Celestia feels bewilderment

Well, what can i say, my pet? Love changes... or better yet, you never knew me, really. When we ever talked about anything at length?

Despite it all, Celestia chuckles
You got me there. But don't mind me asking, my Queen, when you even begun to become educated enough to support this conversation?

Chryslis laughs
You can fault my multiple setbacks over the years, my spouse... Eventually i begun to adapt to what Equestria has to offer, and tried to learn more. And that, led me here. To you. Even now i feel as i am learning and becoming stronger... POWERFUL... Exciting, isn't it? Are you excited to know what i can do? To learn, how WE can bend this world? Together? 
[16:35]Flovv Krovv: flourish
[17:09]Flovv Krovv: Well, Celestia, if it doesn't work out, just send me on the Moon and declare my rule a tyrant's regime for books of history she chuckled lightheartedly We can even try again in few millenias, if you would have me...
I'm just joking, of course. But, you know... she glanced at Tirek's skull It would seem in character for you, to solve problems like that.

Now, what kind of good princess would I be if I just... *sent all my problems to the moon?
She made a small chuckle.
No... as a princess, I must learn to work with and cooperate with my wife, no matter how insufferable she can be...

You touched my shriveled dark heart yet again, Celestia...

And this was worse of all to hear and see, this honesty in words of evil Queen, her look of pure adoration. Some part of Celestia wanted just to scream and stop it all. She haven't felt so flabbergasted in years.
