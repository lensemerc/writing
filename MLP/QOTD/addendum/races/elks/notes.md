Oh, that's a great one! Elks and deer do fit with Elves. I mean, they're elegant and graceful, and they definitely fit some stereotypes about elves as being mystical creatures that you only see once in a while. They usually prefer to stay out of sight, as do many Elvish races. I see the connection!
