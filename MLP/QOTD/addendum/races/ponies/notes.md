I'm not familiar with this... "Lord of the Rings," but Hobbits sound like quite fascinating beings. They sound like they resemble ponies in a lot of ways, being simple countryfolk with simple lives and simple minds. Although, as we all know, all creatures have something that sets them apart from other creatures, so I hope the Hobbits have some distinctive characteristics that set them apart.

Indeed. They're also very friendly, love food and drink and parties, and value loyalty to family and friends. Some ponies are a bit more sophisticated than Hobbits, though. And some ponies are a bit more... "eccentric" than Hobbits. But many ponies do share common traits with them.
