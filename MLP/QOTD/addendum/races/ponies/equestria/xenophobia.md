Just saying...

- They were all racist to each other before the Windegos kinda forced them to make peace and harmony
    
- Their language ("everypony") is very pony-centric and they're overall very isolationist, to the point of apparently not noticing the hippogriffs disappearing or the Storm King's conquests. They do seem to have known much about other creatures, with Spike sometimes even arguably being viewed as more of an animal than a person, and Twilight of all ponies having a lack of knowledge of dragon biology.
    
- Segregation of non-ponies is apparently legal and the head of the EAA can openly be bigoted against non-ponies.
    
- ~~Simply being a changeling is apparently a crime, even though individual changelings are intelligent creatures and not a hive mind.~~
    
- Edit: a revised version of the above point. While the Crystal Empire arguably had good cause to be on guard against Changelings, the fact Shinning claimed there were no good changelings kinda crosses the line from being alert for a possible spy/infiltration to being outright xenophobic.
    
- The trio was able to stir enough racial tensions between the three tribes to cause Equestrian society to collapse back into tribalism once the princesses are taken out of the picture.
    
- If Discord's story is accurate, some new pony caused everypony to become racist against each other again during Twilight's reign.
    
- And by the start of G5 the pony kinds are all racist at each other again and there is no mention of the other creatures so presumably they're back to their old isolationist tedenecies.
    

Edit:

- Almost forgot the conflict with the buffalo. The ponies are straight up doing literal colonisation.
    

Another edit:

- Even the pony students (sans Sandbar. Sandbar is chill) at the School of Friendship got convinced to turn against their non-pony classmates
---
- Equestria apparently did nothing while Griffonstone fell to economic ruin, only sending emissaries when the cutie map decided to -- and Twilight's exposition in the beginning of that episode seemed to indicate she had absolutely no idea how bad Griffonstone had become. She was nerding out about ancient history because that's all she had read.
    
- Yakyakistan and Equestria hadn't opened their borders "in hundreds of moons" according to Twilight, and the whole alliance was designed and concocted by Twilight... not Celestia... and basically done behind Celestia's back. Because Twilight wanted to prove her princess-worthiness. I infer the "hundreds of moons" description to mean that the borders _used_ to be open, a long time ago.
    
- Ponies acted like they knew very little of zebras, dragons, and griffons in the earlier seasons.
    
- In the earlier seasons, when Celestia _did_ talk to foreign diplomats, they were from Maretonia and Saddle Arabia... places mostly made of equines.
    

My headcanon is that ~1000 years ago, after Discord, Tirek, Sombra, the disappearance of their allied nation Crystal Empire, the disappearance of Starswirl and the Pillars of Equestria, banishing her own sister to the moon and then losing control of the Elements of Harmony, Celestia basically closed off Equestria to the rest of the world and only restarted international diplomacy after the Mane6 recovered control of the Elements.

1000 years of isolationism led to all the ignorance and xenophobia. A few years of Mane6 spreading friendship isn't going to reverse that completely.

I've seen people criticize season 9 for how easily the villains broke the tribes' bonds. It's a perfectly fair complaint, but I actually find it kind of interesting that it's easy to turn the ponies against each other, and I wonder why that is. People have noted that the ponies' culture doesn't always come off looking well depending on the episode, and their fickleness is part of that.

Admittedly, it's probably the kind of thing best left to fanfiction. But the more this happens, the more it feels like somebody in-universe should say, "Boy...ponies kind of suck."

On another note, if people are right that Discord isn't being entirely truthful, he's probably lying through his teeth when he says "I knew I had to hold it together for Fluttershy." Knowing him, he probably did something really nasty to anyone who insulted her.

Yeah, I didn't like it when it was done in Season 9 and I don't like it here either. It just felt too easy in Season 9, Chrysalis even commented on exactly that. All the trio had to do was say some mean words, tell a few rumors and damage some crops and somehow a thousand years of unity and harmony is totally undone. It just seemed ridiculous, I get that the idea was to bring Equestria to it's lowest before raising it back up but still. It shouldn't have been that easy.

But now the comic is saying it happened again? Only 20-30 something years later? Another villain shows up and does the same thing and manages to damage everything even worse this time apparently. Did the ponies learn nothing from "The Ending of the End" at all? It just feels so cynical, despite all the Harmony built before and during the show, apparently any random baddie can show up and tear it all down with ease. It makes it feel like all of Equestria is just waiting for any excuse to let their inner racists out and only the threat of things like Windigoes or losing their magic is what's really stopping them. I never viewed Equestria as a perfect utopia but I sure thought it was better than this.

I was hoping that G5's lack of Harmony was due to something that happened after Twilight's rule, or at least a significant time into it. That wouldn't undervalue the heroes efforts, because things do change with time and even good things eventually fade. But this? It really does feel like it's undercutting them and all of Equestria as a whole.

Also, the filly saying she can't learn from Fluttershy due to what her parents say is an Earth Pony. What's up with that? Either a mistake, or maybe her parents are unicorns but if they're that racist to ponies who can't do magic, what do they think of their daughter, exactly? This bugs the hell out of me.
