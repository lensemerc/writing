Equestria is a monarchist state where I, Queen / Princess Celestia, rule as the Monarch alongside my sister Princess Luna. Our rule is the only thing that stands between Equestria and its impending doom by external threats and the chaos of civil war. We are responsible for providing a sense of order and stability in a world where magic, supernatural creatures and fantastical artifacts can easily derail your average pony's life. Our government is a monarchy with a semi-constitutional nature. Certain matters in Equestria are handled by the Equestrian Parliament, the government body that represents the views and interests of Equestria's different races and species.


My advisory body consists of various different ponies working together to ensure the security and well-being of Equestria. It is comprised of many ponies, including members of the various races and species of Equestria and a number of my closest friends and allies. There are also a number of ponies who provide specialized council in their own fields, which also provides valuable perspectives and advice to me regarding the issues facing Equestria. I believe it is best that the views and input of various different ponies are taken into account in making important decisions that will directly affect the lives of all Ponykind.

Yes, that is correct. I have officially stepped down from the position of the Queen of Equestria in order to give the Equestrian Parliament more power within the framework of our semi-constitutional monarchy. Nevertheless, as a sovereign and head of state, I still lead the small council, which acts as the central governing body of Equestria.


The internal ministries of Equestria, representing the various aspects of the nation, are:

1. The Ministry of Health and Wellfare  - responsible for the well-being of Equestria's population and infrastructure.
2. The Ministry of Agriculture
3. The Ministry of Arcane - responsible for the regulation and management of magical artifacts and other dangerous magic.
4. The Ministry of Education and Culture - responsible for Equestria's educational system and research. EEA (Equestrian  Education Association). Chancelor Neighsay
5. The Ministry of Finance. -- Lord Shorn Page
6. The Ministry of Justice
7. The Ministry of Industry
8. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs - responsible for maintaining Equestria's foreign relations, trade and diplomacy. -- Какая-нибудь зашоренная баба

_I smile, as the vision of it all comes together. Our ministry, our changelings, all keeping us at the pinnacle of information. It is the most perfect idea. A spy network. And it's all ours. We have the upper hand, in every situation. We will never be surprised by anyone, and we will always be ready for whatever._ "This... This is brilliant. I love it. I will make it happen. We shall build the ministry of intelligence, together.

A monarch with executive powers that are regularly used but limited in scope by a constitution and legislative body

- The ability to deprive heirs and their descendants of their succession rights, usually for wrong marriage (Most countries still have it but more for PR reasons (like if a royal marries a whore) rather than to prevent marriages with lowborn persons)
    
- The ability to openly punish morganatic marriage, i.e. deprive heirs and their descendants of their succession rights not just because their spouse is socially unacceptable, but also explicitly because the spouse is not noble or not noble enough
    
- The ability to appoint ministers and governors at least partially to one's personal wishes
    
- The ability to dissolve parliament and fire ministers when they screw up
    
- The ability to veto laws
    
- The ability to propose own laws or rule by decree
    
- The ability to grant decorations at one's own wish and not at the whims of a politicized commission that sells them
    
- The ability to grant hereditary (not just personal) titles of nobility - in some figurehead monarchies the nobility outside the Royal Family is not even recognized (Sweden and Norway, de facto) or not awarded under any circumstances, even if a family is for example due to die out in the male line and the last daughter is married to a commoner who is to inherit the estates (Netherlands). In neighboring Germany, a Republic (!) the private heraldic court of the nobility associations regularly grants dispensals, de facto ennobling commoners when it is absolutely necessary to preserve a name or a lineage, in the past also in connection with certain military decorations. While this happened only 50 or so times since WW2 (which is more than appropriate due to the current circumstances), Germany is technically more liberal than the Kingdom (!) of the Netherlands, where nobles regularly raise alarm that the government is trying to make them simply die out. On the other hand, in Belgium the Monarch still regularly grants explicitly hereditary nobility (20-30 people per year, and a minister upon resigning can expect to get a title), and in Liechtenstein and Luxembourg this power remains in theory but is not exercised.
