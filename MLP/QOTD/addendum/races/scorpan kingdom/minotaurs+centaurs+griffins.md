1. ### 23:12_]_Mr. Grimm_:_ 
    
    I had an idea that Minotaur culture is based entirely on puzzles.
    
2. ### _[_23:15_]_Mr. Grimm_:_ 
    
    Their architecture and infrastructure are laid out like labyrinths and their government is full of redundancies and dead ends.
    
3. ### _[_23:15_]_Mr. Grimm_:_ 
    
    Iron Will is considered something of an oddity because of how direct he is.
    
4. ### _[_23:16_]_Mr. Grimm_:_ 
    
    Typical minotaur advice is usually in the form of some metaphor or anecdote you need to sit and think about for a day before you understand.

1. ### _[_11:40_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Though I am more inclined to build their kingdom of origin through intermingling of different monstrous races. Tirek and Scorpan being brothers seem to imply that at least centaurs and gargoyles co-habit, so why not throw minotaurs there too



1. ### 16:10_]_Rayne-The-Skunk_:_ 
    
    _cotenmplating Griffons all having depressing lastnames_ (изменено)
    
2. ### _[_16:10_]_Rayne-The-Skunk_:_ 
    
    Gilda Grimfeather, Gallus Bleakwind, Greta Sombernote (изменено)
    
3. ### _[_16:12_]_Rayne-The-Skunk_:_ 
    
    Gissele TearSong, Genevieve Graveheart (изменено)
    
4. ### _[_16:27_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Griffons in canon are pretty effed up (изменено)
    
5. ### _[_16:28_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    So much that EaW had a need to invent for them a big prosperous kingdom
    
6. ### _[_16:32_]_Rayne-The-Skunk_:_ 
    
    i like to imagine whats unstated is that theres a bunch of other griffon countries just past where the map cuts off (изменено)
    
7. ### _[_16:36_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    I wouldn't count on it. _But_, there is a Tirek's/Scorpan's unnamed kingdom which is at least comprised of minotaurs and gargoyles living together, so I personally would've mix griffons there as well. Seems fitting
    
8. ### _[_16:36_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    They would have sort of HoMM Warlock city mix up going on
