reformed have three gemstone-like objects in their chest

    I have long had the theory that a Changeling hive is literally alive. The chitinous walls, the sphincter-like openings, the slime, the bioluminescence. Plus consider that changelings are not well-built for tunneling, but somehow dig these enormous subterranean hives? I submit that a Hive is, effectively, an enormous Changeling body that grows as directed by a Queen.

    It just lacks a brain, and that’s the role that a Queen plays more than anything else. She connects to the Hive like a Borg Cube and it becomes effectively an extension of her body.

    it can be a side effect of excessive love energy they collectively gorge upon and do not use for anything. a castle built of unrequited love

    seems fitting

    Extra thought. Chrysalis is "The Queen" both in title and biology. The Hive however is "The King".
    
    ### _[_12:31_]_Tipper_:_ 
    
    Mhm. And it’s also why entering a Hive is seen as a suicide mission and why Starlight’s ragtag band of misfits was so unexpected — nobody has ever been suicidal enough to try and retrieve prisoners from a Hive before because it’s supposed to be impossible. Which is exactly why Chrysalis didn’t see it coming.

    And of course, in lean times, they cannibalise the Hive. Feeding on themselves. Hence the emaciated and skeletal bug look.

    yeah, likely so
