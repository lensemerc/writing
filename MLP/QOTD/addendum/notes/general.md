sting of wasp is like an act of love. poison like ejaculation (harvester)

laughs gleefully

"Do you love me for who I am?" Suddenly Chrysalis whispered in Celestia's ear, after a particular deep kiss, a particular strong movement of a foreleg, "Tell me. Do you love me? A monster, a destroyer... Do you love me? I **am** a creature of sin, I have no conscience, I **do not** care for your ponies, and still..." She repeated again, rising above, looking with stark green eyes: "Do you love me?"

"I love you, my dear changeling queen... **No matter what**." *Celestia whispered back between licks.*

"Whether you're a monster, or a destroyer... *Whether you're evil, or good...* It makes no difference to me. Because, yes, I do know you're not a morally good creature, I do know you don't have a conscience... But I don't care. I don't love you for what you do. I love you for what you **are**."

Chrysalis looked at Celestia with strange intent in her green eyes, and then she leaned down, whispering: "What if our love will burn away this world, and destroy the Harmony forever? Would you still love me? Even if everything is doomed?"

She nuzzled into Celestia.

"Even if I am really just a parasite?..."

*Celestia nuzzled back, smiling warmly at the changeling queen.*

"That's the thing, my love... **Your love** is what's keeping this world alive. Your love, your ferocity, your fire... It's all **one and the same** with the fire of life. If you burn this world away, it will be reborn **by your** flames. You're not a parasite, Chrysalis, you're the **source** of love. What I love is **You.** Just you."

Chrysalis's hooves touched on her rump and Celestia's legs immediately opened.

you just do not understand my humor, animal

I want to **melt** in your embrace.

*The princess raised her head and looked down on the changeling queen. As she raised her horn, it glowed brighter and there was a small sound of thunder. As the sound subsided, the princess's tone turned determined.*

"Yes, it is true that the changeling race has been... problematic ever since its creation. But I do not blame the entire hive because of the malfeasance of a few. I may have fought you back in the day, but times have changed now."

"Under my guidance, the changeling race is changing for the better."

*The princess took a deep breath, and stood her ground against the aggressive changeling queen. You've never seen Celestia show such emotion as she did now: rage.*

"No, my dear changeling queen. As a matter of fact, I was going to offer you a chance at redemption and a place as part of the changeling society. But **you** will not force my paw to turn you into stone, to banish you to the moon or sweep you away from existence!"

"You know why? **Because** **I am better than that**!"

Since Harmony is a balancing act, Equestria ruled by clowns.

Ezio and Claudia had a realistic brother/sister relationship. They cared about each other but they weren‚Äôt super close. Most of their scenes together in this game were just them arguing

The Element of Mundanity

I can smell the blood on you from here, Celestia.

Something inside her, little by little, gone numb.
