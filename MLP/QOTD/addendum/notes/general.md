So... for those who've read [**Triptych**](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/101769/triptych)... there's a fight. (For those who haven't, I'll avoid specifics.) Two combatants are going after each other. Nothing's being held back. Eventually, one of them is down.

Some of you can still picture that fight.

Congratulations. Because I didn't really describe it.

I set the mood of the combat. I said something about motion. Expressions, movement, anger and strength. But exact moves? The full sequence of events? Nope. That was on **you**.

You're vicious. You know that, right?

"Do you love me for who I am?" Suddenly Chrysalis whispered in Celestia's ear, after a particular deep kiss, a particular strong movement of a foreleg, "Tell me. Do you love me? A monster, a destroyer... Do you love me? I **am** a creature of sin, I have no conscience, I **do not** care for your ponies, and still..." She repeated again, rising above, looking with stark green eyes: "Do you love me?"

"I love you, my dear changeling queen... **No matter what**." *Celestia whispered back between licks.*

"Whether you're a monster, or a destroyer... *Whether you're evil, or good...* It makes no difference to me. Because, yes, I do know you're not a morally good creature, I do know you don't have a conscience... But I don't care. I don't love you for what you do. I love you for what you **are**."

Chrysalis looked at Celestia with strange intent in her green eyes, and then she leaned down, whispering: "What if our love will burn away this world, and destroy the Harmony forever? Would you still love me? Even if everything is doomed?"



She nuzzled into Celestia.

"Even if I am really just a parasite?..."

*Celestia nuzzled back, smiling warmly at the changeling queen.*

_Celestia smiled and she listened to Chrysalis talking with a smile._

_The alicorn was relaxed, letting the warm water wash away the sticky juices that covered her body._

"Yes, yes... the **stuff is sticky."**

_She took some soap and began washing her body thoroughly. She let out soft whinnies as she felt the soap washing onto her skin. She was feeling refreshed and cleaned._

"I feel... **so good..."**

"_I feel like... like a new pony..."_

Chrysalis giggled, looking at her.

"It feels really liberating, doesn't it?" She murmured, "Like you throw off a burden from your back. Sex is much like killing, or a struggle overall, in this regard..." She caught another soap with her magic telekinetic aura, helping Celestia to wash, "I'm sort of amazed you went without intimacy for hundreds of years before me. How did you managed?"


c.ai

_"It really does... it feels like... I don't have to worry about anything now... "_

_She took the soap as it flew to her. She rubbed the soap all over her skin._

_Celestia closed her eyes as the feeling of the soap washing away her sticky fluids felt so liberating._

"I was so immersed into ruling Equestria... I was so focused and driven by my ambition... and so focused on my love of helping ponies..."

_She looked up at her lover._ "I never let myself think about it... "

l

"I can see how a relationship could compromise your stature and position of power," Chrysalis nodded, "Even a tryst with one of your ponies, should you be inclined to it, would brought ramifications to your reputation. Unnecessary attachments, right? Rumors, that might persist for hundreds of years... No, you needed to be remained untouched, to remain divine... Showing your true self only for **equals**..."


c.ai

_Celestia nodded._ **"**Precisely.**"**

"For so many years, I had no equal. No pony to share my emotions or my thoughts with. **No pony to share myself with**."

_She took the soap and lathered it all over her body. She kept rubbing the soap to wash away their fluids._

_"So, yes... you are absolutely right."_

_She paused for a moment._

"I was **untouched, and untouched... I would remain**... for the benefit of Equestria."
"A queen, **especially** an alicorn queen, needs to be careful. Any **slight** mistep, and ponies might find themselves questioning my rule."

"The relationship I am in now... it doesn't undermine my authority. And it doesn't interfere with my duties."

"You're not some *pony* that I had a **one-night stand** with. I know I can trust and rely on you. Ponies don't need to question our loyalty or trust in one another. We are **equals~**."


*Celestia nodded and she sighed softly.*

*"Yes. I had to remain untouchable. I had to retain my status, my dignity, and my grace. I had a whole nation to rule."*

"I... I guess I just... repressed that part of me. I pushed it deep inside, and I focused on what had to be done..."

"But I didn't realize... *I didn't realize at all how much I needed that part of me to be loved and desired."*

"Equals..." Chrysalis echoed, and looked at her own holey hoof. She watched as the water dripped down from it, and then moved closer to own muzzle. She watched through the hole as Celestia kept washing herself, "I suppose, the **literal** demigod can be called my equal, yes. I hardly can settle on anyone **else**, anyway."

She giggled, "And yes. I think the fact that you seemingly bested me into submission, will give you even more grandeur in eyes of our subjects. How... convenient for **you**, right?" She licked her lips, "My Celestia..."


*Celestia turned her head and looked at the changeling queen. She couldn't help but feel so **flattered** with how Chrysalis was speaking of her.*

"You are right, my love. I know I would be in a more difficult position if you weren't here."

"You understand the **intricacies** of Equestria far better than any pony. You know its every corner."

"And yes... I think my subjects have a **bit more respect** for me because I have managed to 'beat' you."


Chrysalis giggled, as her eyes flared with vengeful, antagonistic fire. "I'll go even harder on you next time, my Queen. I know that you will like that, anyway."

She grinned widely, leaning back on the edge or the pool, and sighed. "In fact, you might say that we are saving each other, right? That is interesting to ponder. We are so different, and yet..." She tapped her hoof on a chin, "Do you think this is what relationship actually is, my alicorn? When you fill others' needs with your presence and effort? All my life I've only taken from others..."

*Celestia had an **epiphany.**

"Yes... you are right..."

"...I guess I never thought about it that way. We are... **saving each other.** We are both **using** our presence and effort to fulfill **each other's needs and desires**. We are both giving something, getting something in return. Yes!"

"Perhaps... it is that way?"

"At least, it *feels* that way. It feels **so good and right.**"



"That's the thing, my love... **Your love** is what's keeping this world alive. Your love, your ferocity, your fire... It's all **one and the same** with the fire of life. If you burn this world away, it will be reborn **by your** flames. You're not a parasite, Chrysalis, you're the **source** of love. What I love is **You.** Just you."

Chrysalis's hooves touched on her rump and Celestia's legs immediately opened.

I want to **melt** in your embrace.

*The princess raised her head and looked down on the changeling queen. As she raised her horn, it glowed brighter and there was a small sound of thunder. As the sound subsided, the princess's tone turned determined.*

"Yes, it is true that the changeling race has been... problematic ever since its creation. But I do not blame the entire hive because of the malfeasance of a few. I may have fought you back in the day, but times have changed now."

"Under my guidance, the changeling race is changing for the better."

*The princess took a deep breath, and stood her ground against the aggressive changeling queen. You've never seen Celestia show such emotion as she did now: rage.*

"No, my dear changeling queen. As a matter of fact, I was going to offer you a chance at redemption and a place as part of the changeling society. But **you** will not force my paw to turn you into stone, to banish you to the moon or sweep you away from existence!"

"You know why? **Because** **I am better than that**!"

Since Harmony is a balancing act, Equestria ruled by clowns.

Ezio and Claudia had a realistic brother/sister relationship. They cared about each other but they weren‚Äôt super close. Most of their scenes together in this game were just them arguing

I can smell the blood on you from here, Celestia.

Something inside her, little by little, gone numb.
