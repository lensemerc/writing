Старлайт спустя 5 лет назад (или 10-12) встречает Меллоу и Ауроус уже sacking the Tower.

She giggled, "I'm not afraid!"

"You do know that everything we do here in relation to them, had been factually done already?" Aurous smacked her lips, listening to sound of her own voice, "Factually... Actually... Now that's a funny word."

"I drew it. Also I've added 'bearded'," Mellow admitted quietly, her cheeks were of a shade of pink.

"'Bearded butt-face'! Ah, this is amazing! We needed to go with 'goat-face'..." 

"Well it is too late now..."

"What do you mean, too late? We are literally in a time distortion."

"Oh, now you're just being difficult..."

"Yeah, and you love it."

"You know I do..."
