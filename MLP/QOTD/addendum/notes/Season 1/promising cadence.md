    As a grim middle-aged straight man I had some trouble with finding a character voice for what can be percieved as my direct opposite - a pony princess of Love from a magical land. So I needed to write extra, just to be sure that I've nailed it Cadance seems to be pretty integral character for a plot about _romance_ with _Chrysalis_ taken seriously, because they can be seen in many ways as direct reflections of each other, while being heavily built around the themes of love. You can't really thoroughly discuss one in the setting, without touching up on another. Before securing a conception of the plot in the past year (time sure flies), I went through multiple iterations of how connection of Cadance and Chrysalis, thematic or otherwise, would play out. They both can be much more than can be seen on the surface... But suffice to say, they will never be on friendly terms here. Nope. Can't see _that_ happening. (изменено)

    Shhh... It's the magic of love calling out to your heart. _She nuzzles closer, pulling Chrysalis deeper into the water. She grins, caressing and stroking the queen's mane and body. She nuzzles closer, her tail stroking the queen's back._ I've never felt this way before about anyone. In life, I've tried, again and again to pursue true love. And I finally found it. _She pulls the queen even deeper._ I'm so glad to be here with you, my love... _She smiles._
