“The day after tomorrow is the thousandth year of the Summer Sun Celebration!” implies that _Summer Sun Celebration_ has not been held prior to Nightmare Moon. Why? Was it the first new holiday of [the New Equestria?](https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/692148/rtac-12-n-archy) Maybe. Possibly, even the day of its founding, though that is doubtful, because…

Twilight’s “Take a note please. To the Princess,” suggests Spike is capable of sending notes to other ponies, but we never come back to that and we never see Spike send letters to anyone else, except Luna, in [**Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep**](https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/799440/points-of-canon-s5x13-do-princesses-dream-of-magic-sheep), even when it would be expedient. In fact, every time when a letter would resolve the plot, Spike is shuffled out of it.

Princess Celestia writes _really_ fast. Also, notably, it sounds like she wrote _two_ letters: The first one that just brushes Twilight off and the second one that finally sends her off to Ponyville. The first one starts with “My dearest most faithful…” while the second one starts with “My dear Twilight.” There was probably at least one more letter between the two, because some context seems to be missing.

The mysterious four objects that collide with the moon are too bright to be regular stars, of course, and to be honest, look much more like some variation on [moon dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_dog) to me – that is, purely optical phenomena, possibly magic-induced – they’re so _symmetrical._

Nightmare Moon invokes lightning without the use of a horn. It actually never lights up through this entire two-parter, she _never_ casts magic with her horn, just the eyes.

“But… you told me it was all an old pony tale.” Notably, Celestia did not say anything of the sort on screen, and there wasn’t anything we heard strong enough for Twilight to conclude that, either. There had to be a conversation between these two letters.

Twilight can only reasonably ask this question if the number of ponies wearing the title of a princess well exceeds the amount of ponies she cares to remember. I’m sure every foal knows the _three._ See [**Ticket Master**](https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/734841/points-of-canon-s1x03-the-ticket-master) and Rarity’s statement that she would become a princess upon marrying Blueblood: non-alicorn princesses must exist.

Changelings dive-bombing the Mane 6 light up their horns to produce the shields they use to protect themselves on impact. Yes, no matter what howard035 says, it’s a spell, because it behaves in all other respects like one. Presumably, only a certain subset of changelings is trained to use it.

Cadance picks the very last moment to insist on using “Cadance” instead of “Mi Amore Cadenza.” You only do this if Celestia kept resisting and insisting on using the full name for months.

“Cadance, if you could use your crystal magic to create an aurora above the stage, the sun and the moon will shine through it and create a truly amazing light show!” Twilight expects that Cadance can do this. There is no indication anywhere else in canon that she knows this kind of trick and we never actually see it done.

Notice that all the other sapient races with hands so far observed on Pony Earth have four fingers – this is particularly noticeable in [**Equestria Girls**](https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/780389/points-of-canon-equestria-girls), where Sunset turns from a five-fingered human into a four-fingered demon. Grubber also has four fingers, as does every Klugetown resident, most of which are unique. Storm King’s storm troopers is the only species which has _three_. The only other exception is Storm King himself, who is very similar to his storm troopers – _but_, instead of the paws, has _cloven hooves_ on his legs, and is referred to as such in speech.

It’s interesting that both Celestia, Luna _and_ Cadance recognize the gorgon grenades as dangerous the moment the first one is thrown. It’s also interesting that instead of attempting to deflect or bounce them off, Cadance chooses to use a shield, which they eventually phase through. As a side note, the grenades are never named in the movie, so I wonder where the name actually came from.

“You gotta be kiddin’ me! I can move the sun?”

- Notice that the Storm King does not consciously wish to move the stellar objects, he’s just trying out what the staff can do, _without_ fully realizing its capabilities.
- It’s highly likely that at least the Storm King himself was not aware that ponies are in charge of the solar cycle, or he would expect this ability, or treat the invasion of Equestria with a lot more caution. Which is very, very, _very fucking strange._

“The Empire’s magic is powerful. It cannot fall again, my sister.” Luna’s statement clearly implies that Crystal Empire under Sombra is a threat all by itself. See also “Even my knowledge of the Empire is limited. But what I do know is that it contains a powerful magic.”

- “She will succeed at her task. And when she does, we’ll know that she is that much closer to being ready.” I wonder if any interesting interpretations based on assuming that “she” is Cadance, rather than Twilight, exist.
- The whole presentation involves a crystal, which Celestia keeps under a glass dome. The actual significance of that object is not explained.
