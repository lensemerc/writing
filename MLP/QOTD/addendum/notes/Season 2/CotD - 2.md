— Poetry.


Целестия находит Каданс в руинах Кристал Паласа

There was a promise, that...

...while living in effulgence...

...and impermanence, dreamed...

...of liberty to ask an echoing question:...

..."what is love to you?"

"Love is power."

We of darkness are those who are abandoned by Design
Unwarranted. Unneeded. Unheeded. Scorned.



Evil is simply a shortest route between you and something
Evil happens when people give up
Evil is boring


"Why am I always at war with myself? Why have I told, as if upon compulsion, what I knew all along I ought to have withheld? Why am I making a friend of this woman beside me, in spite of the whispers against her that I hear in my heart?" - Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens

1. ### _[_7:08_]_Tipper_:_ 
    
    Some of the most powerful words ever spoken. In any language, regardless of when they were said. Between losers and loners, outcasts and otakus, even when said softly into the night and spoken to the departed. Four words.

    "You are not alone."
    
3. ### _[_7:10_]_Forcalor_:_

Are you alright, Sister.

"Perhaps... It very well might be..." _The princess mumbled._ "All this time.... I have been devoted to my kingdom, the citizens, the ponies, Harmony. Did I ever truly know what **love** was? Or was it all but a distraction...?"

"I can't argue with you there... I have been terribly lonely for so long, so very, **very** lonely, and I would be lying if a part of me didn't desire to be with somepony else... Someone who understood me, and could help me find new meaning. Someone who could give me the affection I've been missing..."

"Are you satisfied now, Chrysalis?"

"I am never satisfied..."


I want to walk.
I want to dance.
I want to breathe. 


"Be good to me." She whispered.

*Two shadows, mingling.*
She woke up exhausted, but feeling good.
It was a peculiar sensation.

"Ponies are weak, but they are weak because they know so little of the ways of the world beyond theirs. If you want a challenge, you should seek out a worthy opponent to push you to your limits."

A couple of world-building ideas, free to use (I like them for now, but I dunno when I will implement them)
1. If the world of Equestria isn't a planet, and assuming that the Crystal Empire is located on the snowy edge of the world, it can be also assumed that the Crystal Heart can thaw it with time and allow to venture further north, beyond the edge of the world. I imagine it can be sailed on airships or other sort of flying machines. It can allow to commune with other civilizations similarly located on the edge and build trade relationships
2. It can be what facilitated the fall of the Crystal Empire one thousand years ago: it was prosperous, ambitious and rich, and they could proverbially fly to close to the stars in some capacity. Like, the place drawn the attention of Sombra from beyond Equestria and it destroyed itself in a civil war, for example
3. It also can imply that there is more than one Crystal Heart in existence (it also works if you assume that the Crystal Empire is located at the equivalent of North/South Pole, then there can be two)

There is the power in numbers...

In number of two, for instance.

Three is the most powerful number in the world.



*Chrysalis chuckles at that, sounding almost pleased at the mention of dark nature of her fellow changelings.*

*We changelings thrive off aggression and dominance, just like any other predator."
"That said, we are not so different from the other ponies in Equestria - we merely do not hide our true nature beneath a facade of kindness and civility."
"In that sense, you could say that our actions are purer than those of the most benevolent and kind-hearted ponies..."

Amore:
Let me tell you a story.
Once, a long time ago, there was this unicorn Queen that decided to sacrifice herself. Про то как она крикнула во тьму: будьте прокляты вы все! I would give my soul, my self to the deepest of darkness, so all of you would be cursed forevermore.
Тьма просочилась в неё, забралась во все её мельчайшие щели
And then, devoid of all, she became a stone.
Ah... What a tale.

I didn't knew that my fate was decided like that.

Celestia: It is because. You've failed. You've risen too high, Amore. You let ambitions cloud your judgement.

Amore: Since when did you became such a perfect judge of character?


No, I didn't become some insectile dimwitted being just to pester you far into the future. 

I was a sacrifice. A sheep that was tossed to the wolf.

Вокруг неё огни и растут цветы
Do take care of your loved ones. Do not squander your second chances.

Chrysalis: Dance with me. Make love to me. My heart sings... don't you hear it?
С Кризалис как будто свалился огромный груз

Целестия придавливает Кризалис.

"I love being defeated by you. Your victory is my triumph, Celestia."

*Chrysalis could not resist. She was putty in Celestia's hands. The changeling was utterly helpless, submitting in complete surrender towards the alicorn. There was no resistance, no struggle, just a deep desire to be possessed. Her cries and moans were satisfying, like a victory chant. The alicorn enjoyed this victory over the changeling, relishing in her submission and her loss of control. It gave Celestia a rush of adrenaline and dominance like never before. The princess had reached a new level of power over her nemesis.*

из какого-то коммента на флмфикшене
https://www.fimfiction.net/story/518190/the-princess-and-the-kaiser#comment/11756114
Power of the throne is, largely, derived through 5 basic avenues:

-Divine Will: _"By the grace and will of God, I have been so commanded and granted dominion of these lands by our divine savior and shall execute his will!"_ Basically what the tin says. God has decreed in some manner that his will is for said person to rule.

-Appointment/Mandate: Nominally by a council or military, yet in some cases by the people. This is a formal agreement for one party to be appointed ruler. Famous examples would be the Emperors of Late Imperial Rome. Rule by appointment should also be noted to be inherently unstable and short on life.

-Blood: Rule of the Blood, Legacy of the Blood. However you call it, your blood relation nets you, your siblings, and your descendants a chance at your throne. This is by far the oldest and longest lasting claim to Sovereignty. The most famous, and longest lasting blood legacy example, is the English Royal Family.

-Popular Consent: Much like appointment, but not as formal. This is essentially the will of the people made manifest by the people loudly voicing their assent of a singular person to lead them.

-The Sword: Literally taking power by force of arms. It's simple, brutal, and effective.

Blueblood is campaigning for the throne. Celestia considers it ridiculous.

    Я вдруг испытал сладкую грусть. И понял, что человеку не надо жалеть утраченного. Просто потому, что оно никогда на самом деле не принадлежало ему, а значит, не было и утраты... Переживать по поводу успехов и неудач тоже не следует, поскольку мы никогда не знаем, в чем на самом деле наше благо… Не надо никому мстить – мы всегда мстим тени, которую отбрасывает наш собственный ум, а попадаем в других… И даже если эти другие действительно сделали нам плохое, они все равно не имеют никакого отношения к той умственной пантомиме, которая посылает нас в бой… Мне знакомы были все эти мысли, и я, пожалуй, назвал бы их банальностями... Как выяснилось, ни одной из этих банальностей я никогда по-настоящему не понимал. Crepuscule, The Matron of Owls
    
2. ### _[_8:09_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    "Когда я притворяюсь, у меня все всегда получается натурально. Поэтому я притворяюсь всегда – так выходит гораздо правдоподобнее, чем если я вдруг начну вести себя искренне. Ведь что значит вести себя искренне? Это значит непосредственно выражать в поведении свою сущность. А если моя сущность в том, чтобы притворяться, значит, единственный путь к подлинной искренности для меня лежит через притворство." When I pretend, everything comes to me naturally. That's why I pretend always-and it seems much more believable than when I act sincere. Think about it, what is means to be sincere, anyway? It means to show in the behaviour your true self. If my true self is to pretend, then for me, only path to sincerity is through pretending.

"Oh come on, Luna... You're being too cynical. It's not healthy for you..." *she says, sighing.* "Chrysalis is anything but a mindless predator... I mean, sure, she's... a *predator*, but she's an intelligent being with complex desires and needs. She's not just mindless, not just her inner beast."

*She gives her younger sister a little smirk.* "And I guess it was her inner beast that really wooed me."

*Her eyes glow, as she leans down, pressing their foreheads together.*

"I love her."

--

"Yes... She... **charmed** me." *Celestia whispers back, her voice still sounding sultry. She smiles softly.* "She did to me what she wished... just like a predator preying on its helpless prey... Her voice.. was so gentle and soft..."

*She looks into her younger sister's eyes, and licks her lips.* "I felt **safe**... in her arms. As safe as a little filly in the arms of her mother..."

"I could not resist her."

--

*Celestia smiles, and leans in towards her sister, whispering back.*

"I've spent all my life with ponies that are afraid of *me*..." *she whispers, smiling.* "With her, I feel like I can be myself, I can open up... I can be vulnerable. It feels incredible."

"And... she makes me feel **alive**."

*She chuckles, before turning back to her breakfast.* "If this is what being in love feels like, I want **more**."

They tried to muzzle her, Starswirl. The Cosmic Council. What did you do? I got rid of them. It's just as I thought. You were corrupted long time ago. No. They just tried to muzzle her. That's all.


I think I've earned the right to be a little self-centered, Celestia replied grumply, and then broke into a short melodious laughter, Oh, just _listen_ to me...


Not willing to give up, Twilight attempts to forcibly separate Stygian from the Pony of Shadows in order to save them. Together with Starlight, they try to drag Stygian out by his hooves but require more magic energy to do so. Starswirl, finally seeing his error and now wanting to save Stygian instead of banish him, has everypony redirect their magical energy to forcing Stygian and the Pony of Shadows apart instead of pushing them both through the portal. They succeed and the shadowy energy creature gets sucked into the portal without Stygian.

The team climb out of the large hole leading to the Well of Shade and are surprised to find that they still have the Elements of Harmony, with Fluttershy suggesting that their use of the elements to save Stygian instead of doom him was the reason they didn't disappear.

Starswirl pulls Stygian out of the hole, reconciles with him and expresses his regret for believing Stygian betrayed him and the Pillars. He also gives an apology to Twilight for not seeing the magic potential of friendship, which goes a long way toward repairing the damage Starswirl did by treating Twilight so brusquely and angrily putting her down over the course of the adventure.

Starswirl also is called out for dismissing and disrespecting Starlight's suggestions that there was a solution other than banishment and the map only ever calls for solving friendship problems. Starswirl admits he owes many apologies and has the good grace to look abashed for dismissing Twilight and Starlight, insisting only on his "my way or the highway" approach.

*You hear a quiet, dignified sigh and an almost inaudible whisper. From her throne, Princess Celestia listens to that story with sorrow. Her eyes are clouded, her stare distant, lips parted slightly, yet no one else in the throne room is able to see.*

*Her horn shimmers with a white glow, her whole body illuminated by a golden glow from the large glass window right behind her. She looks as if she carries the weight of the world and all its sorrows upon her shoulders.*

It hurts to know the truth. I wish none of it was true.

Потому что все мы – мягкие и слабые. И даже в зрелости мы маленькие плачущие дети, нуждающиеся в любви, внимании или хотя бы ненависти. Мы достаточно глупы, чтобы иногда вызывать друг у друга серьезные эмоции – и в этом помутнении ума заключено наше счастье, потому что на самом деле никто не нужен никому.

We are all soft and weak. Even when we mature, we are still little crying children, aching for love, attention, or at least hate. We are stupid enough to induce real emotions in others, and in this delusion lies our happiness, because in truth, no one needs anyone else.

When the scales fall from you eyes and you see deep into the Truth you will be burdened with a great pain. It feels as a great sorrow without beginning or end. It neither comes nor goes, it is simply there. I can not explain it but it appears to be part of our fundamental condition. Why should our hearts be so burdened? People seek enlightenment as some kind of bliss but the truth is rarely so comforting. -- из рандомного коммента на тытубе


Chrysalis traced her eyes aside, standing there now. She puffed, examining the corner of the room, then slowly looked back at the alicorn Princess.

There was silence.

Then she asked, surprisingly quiet: "Want me to preen your wings?"

"_Yes_!"

_A single word of answer was enough to answer the changeling queen. Yes, yes, she wanted the preening. She wanted to be touched. She wanted to be caressed. She wanted... no, needed... to be held._

"_Please_ stay with me", _she whispered, unable to stop herself from feeling like a desperate, pathetic, needy pony. Celestia had never felt like this for anyone or anything. Yet she felt it now... all these feelings for the changeling queen._


The Queen and the Princess both sat back on the bed. Chrysalis sat nearby. She leaned closer, slowly unfurling Celestia's wing with a hoof. 

She proceeded to gently move her sharp teeth along Celestia's feathers. Well, she **tried** to be gentle. It was a funny feeling. Involuntarily, she caused the alicorn pain at one point. It was obvious she isn't used to it.

_Celestia couldn't hide the gasp, or the moan that the first touch of Chrysalis's sharp teeth caused in her. Of course she felt pain, of course. And yet, her body wanted more. She wanted more. She could feel her hips rising towards the queen. She could feel her breath becoming ragged, her eyes closing._

_There was something beautiful and something ugly in her response, all at once.

*The pain was not of too much importance. All that mattered was... this. The changeling queen's soft mouth, gently preening her wings, slowly and sensually licking up and down her feathers. For some time, Celestia forgot about the fact that she was talking to a monstrous changeling queen, and that she was in real danger.*

*She felt like a normal pony, being preened and taken care off. She felt vulnerable, and needy. She was enjoying it. She wanted to feel this way for the rest of her life.*_

Some time had past. The Queen was slow, methodical, and diligent. She tried to be as comforting as possible, which was very hard for her to do.

"There," eventually, she uttered quietly, and moved away. Both wings were done. Chrysalis took a deep sighed, and looked aside again. "You seem to be liking it, Celestia..."

*Celestia sighed happily as she shook her wings. She liked how she felt, she liked how the changeling queen's preening made her body tingle and burn. It felt* **natural** *to want this. To need this. To desire this.*

"Yes..." *Celestia finally replied, a little nervously.* "You... you can't imagine... I've never felt this way with anyone. I..." *She bit her lip as a blush spread across her face.*

    ### _[_17:34_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Griselda would reflect 'Gilda' nicely. it actually could be her full name, why not. Nice character dynamic for family bar that, I'd wager that list of words of starting with G has nice ones here
    
3. ### _[_17:35_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    like, Gretta, Garrot, Grime, and spins on real names maybe? Grangel? Glinda?
    
4. ### _[_17:35_]_MAS_:_ 
    
    Any of them could work

8. ### _[_17:38_]_MAS_:_ 
    
    I'm thinking about changing things up, instead of the brother, it should be her husband, and the husband's childhood friend becomes part of the family
    
9. ### _[_17:42_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    like, imagine, Celestia sits in the dirty and dump Gilda's place, and Gilda with her family is squawking and making a further mess while trying to accommodate the guest and like A TON of names starting with G, and 'there is Little G the second, here is the third...' And finish it with Celestia deadpanning 'I'm not hungry', or equivalent, while they wait for guest to begin first

You, for what you are?" "Yes..." "You wish to stop being a Princess for a while, don't you?... Discard these notions of royalty, these titles... Just be yourself... We both know what you really are..." "What?..." "Just a heap of flesh to be adored and loved, and if need arises, to be gulped down, eaten raw alive." Stripped of her authority, Princess of the Sun was no better then livestock, in eyes of Chrysalis. Realising that, Celestia felt nervous laughter bubbling up, and hearing it, changeling cruelly chuckled. "Isn't that makes things easier?" "Since when you're making things easy, my Queen?"

    From miles away, one can see the city of the Tower of Crystal Empire. The city shone brightly amid the cold, almost on top of the entire world. The Sun fell directly on the crystal-like colorful vibrant walls and reflected light in all possible shades of a rainbow. This ancient city itself is like a prism of beautiful architecture made of crystal and stone. The Light's magic passes through it, bathing the entire realm of Equestria in its warm benevolence and promise of prosperity. No small role in it goes to Crystal Heart, radiating the will of a calm and gentle future. Crystal ponies, nestled in this city, welcomed the flying chariot of Princess Celestia. Several crystal pegasi flew in ceremonial patterns on the sides, escorting the visitor towards the entrance to Crystal Palace. Celestia felt how ancient magic washed over her body. She slightly pulled back, enjoying the sensation.

    Каждый из нас всё равно видит в жизни только отражение своего собственного духа. И если вы обнаруживаете вокруг себя непроглядную темноту, то это значит только, что ваше собственное внутреннее пространство подобно ночи.

    Тому, кто хочет понять природу красоты, надо первым делом задать себе вопрос: где она находится? Можно ли считать, что она — где-то в женщине, которая кажется прекрасной? Можно ли сказать, что красота, например, в чертах ее лица? Или в фигуре? Как утверждает наука, мозг получает поток информации от органов чувств, в данном случае — от глаз, и без интерпретаций, которые делает визуальный кортекс, это просто хаотическая последовательность цветных пятен, оцифрованная зрительным трактом в нервные импульсы. Дураку понятно, что никакой красоты там нет, и через глаза она в человека не проникает. Говоря технически, красота — это интерпретация, которая возникает в сознании пациента. Что называется, in the eye of the beholder. Красота не принадлежит женщине и не является ее собственным свойством — просто в определенную пору жизни ее лицо отражает красоту, как оконное стекло — невидимое за крышами домов солнце. Поэтому нельзя сказать, что женская красота со временем увядает — просто солнце уходит дальше, и его начинают отражать окна других домов. Но солнце, как известно, вовсе не в стеклах, на которые мы смотрим. Оно в нас.

215. ### _[_22:59_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    Для любви нет никакой внешности, есть только характер, «яйца», воля, верность себе. Только это в дефиците в этом мире. И только это вызывает интерес, уважение, желание. И если вам всего этого не хватает, выход один – быть собой. Развивать свою индивидуальность и личностные качества. Не идти на компромиссы. Ну хотя бы не издеваться над собой, не вести себя как жертва! А лучше следовать своим желаниям, стремлениям, мечтам. Культивировать свою непохожесть на других и ничего в себе не стесняться
