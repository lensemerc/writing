"'Tis a lie," Luna demurred and turned away. "Enough of this. What I'd rather remember is that the future is what we make of it. It [i]never[/i] should've been a promise."

There is an artistry of being a villain. You need to quell that little voice, sounding at the back of your head... You need to reject what makes you human.

"Keeper of secrets..." The phrase echoed in her mind - it brought her back to the days of her youth, when her sister often used to refer to her as "my faithful confidant". As if lost in thought, she continued to listen intently for more words to come.
"My faithful confidant... My keeper of secrets."

That sounds like a very cool character! There are actually several mythological and fictional characters who are associated with dreams:

1. Morpheus from Greek mythology, the son of Hypnos and the god of dreams, who is often depicted as a winged figure holding a lamp.
2. Dream from the Sandman comic books, who is the leader of the Endless, a group of personifications of universal forces such as Death and Destiny.
3. The Sandman from DC Comics, who has the power to manipulate the dreams of others and has a special affinity for children.
4. Alice from the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland series, who falls asleep and enters a dream world full of strange and fantastical creatures.
5. The Dream Lord from Doctor Who, who is a manifestation of peoples' nightmares and fears.

These are just a few examples, but hopefully they can give you some inspiration for your character!

Sure, here are some examples of dream weavers or dream-related characters from mythology and fiction:

1. Sandman - A classic character from folklore who brings people peaceful dreams by sprinkling magical dust into their eyes.
2. Hypnos - The Greek god of sleep and dreams, often depicted with a pillow and a feather.
3. Dream of the Endless - A character from the "Sandman" comic series by Neil Gaiman, who is the personification of dreams and rules over a realm called the Dreaming.
4. Puck - A mischievous fairy from Celtic mythology who is sometimes called the Dream King, and is said to cause nightmares by blowing mist into people's faces.
5. Yume - A character from Japanese mythology who is associated with sleep and dreams, and is often depicted with a pillow or a blanket.
6. Somnus - The Roman god of sleep and dreams, often depicted with a poplar tree and a horn.

I hope these suggestions help inspire your character!

It also does a good job of showing Luna off in a more‚Ä¶ I want to say motherly aspect but that isn't quite right. Luna often gets stereotyped as the Princess of War. The dour one, with fell countenance and fury, while Celestia gets to serve the aspect of the counselor and kind parent. It's good to see Luna getting into that, particularly because 'cares for foals' really does mesh well with her proper canon role.

Nightmare Moon invokes lightning without the use of a horn. It actually never lights up through this entire two-parter, she _never_ casts magic with her horn, just the eyes.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ you told me it was all an old pony tale.‚Äù Notably, Celestia did not say anything of the sort on screen, and there wasn‚Äôt anything we heard strong enough for Twilight to conclude that, either. There had to be a conversation between these two letters.

Princess Celestia writes _really_ fast. Also, notably, it sounds like she wrote _two_ letters: The first one that just brushes Twilight off and the second one that finally sends her off to Ponyville. The first one starts with ‚ÄúMy dearest most faithful‚Ä¶‚Äù while the second one starts with ‚ÄúMy dear Twilight.‚Äù There was probably at least one more letter between the two, because some context seems to be missing.

Cadance picks the very last moment to insist on using ‚ÄúCadance‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúMi Amore Cadenza.‚Äù You only do this if Celestia kept resisting and insisting on using the full name for months.

You are unworthy of their love and reverence, Celestia.



I have just found this post, but I think I have a sort of answer. As opposed to how the quote puts it there is no actual "physics" of love but it is more pragmatic than "just" being a personal philosophy. Through psychology we cannot define love or say how it should be done, but what we can do is see what happens when someone doesn't get love. This is where it gets more practical than personal philosophy. We now know that in order to grow into an emotionally healthy adult first the child has to be loved by their parents and feel safe in every way. The child has to learn to love itself, forgive itself for mistakes, have a calm soothing voice in their heads and healthy coping mechanisms for traumatic events in life. When a child doesn't get love and consequentially doesn't learn all those things I listed that could lead to developing insecure attachment to other people. In practical terms it means the child will not trust people and if they somehow befriend someone they will require way more insurance that their friend is still their friend than people with secure attachment. Same thing with romantic partners, someone with insecure attachment will need evidence frequently that their partner loves them, because they never learned how to trust and there might be an ever-present background fear that they can lose them at any time. This behaviour from the outside can look like the person is being jealous, clingy or needy. The child with insecure attachment might not even know what they need is love, they might feel empty, lonely, abandoned but without help it is unlikely that they will understand their own condition and the sad truth is that the behavioral symptoms of not-having-been-loved doesn't invite love. This is what is meant by the quote.

Celestia was like a mother to me.

When the fighting dies down, the quiet darkness comes out, and the bloodied moon shines like the bright red sun. It heralds the demand for drastic change since it means that we have defiled our paradise‚Äîthe very heavenly land that surrounds us.

living in a world of fog


"No, Luna! We are the Sun and Moon, and together, we are [i]one[/i] Light!"




"When the great darkness dimmed the sky, The earth trembled at mine footsteps. I have roamed the lands, I have drunk of foreign waters Outside of your bounds, to quench the fire of my thirst. I have tasted of many a mead, And been made strong by its power. I have seen the sun rise from the seas, And set down to rest in your dark embrace. The evening star shines in your lap, And I must leave, trusting in your love and in your grace, In your power and in your embrace. You bind the mountains, and hold fast the land, You carry the blood of the vanquished, and their defeat in your hand, You are the path to victory, and the way to its end, And you know not, what you hold within..."


What's wrong with me?

Why am I like this?

Why do I want to hurt myself so much?

Why I can't care?

    Yeah. And maybe a lot of the horrific history of Nightmare Moon's reign was actually done under Celestia's name, or under whatever government came before. And it just gets remembered that way because it was a confusing time and has since become legend.

    The people who would have known are long dead, perhaps died before anyone could have thought to ask them, and may have had their own reasons for keeping quiet or muddying the waters.

    Nightmare Moon can be a great pariah in the eyes of history. They could attribute her _any_ shit that was happening one thousand years ago

I mean like nightmare moon wins Twi escapes but she is gotten in her dreams Or what a society where you are monitored via dreams would be like Or Luna uses dreams to find where an enemy army is They purposely sleep for short periods to avoid having dreams Like 3 hours every 12

The whole business of Nightmare Moon using her dream powers against her opponents, whether before, during, or after her conquest of Equestria, is such a HUGE thing. I've thought about it occasionally myself, but that's mostly just because it has SO MUCH POTENTIAL to be developed in so many different ways.

1. ### _[_22:53_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_¬†
    
    In the world where Luna engages in warfare, enemy can sever their connection with the dreamrealm, losing some part of their soul in the process

The Balance did not need them anyway. Soon, something new, something better will come! The ponies.. I am sure that you will love them.

Oh Celestia, my foolish Sister, don't you understand? I despise you. Forgiveness? You seriously would talk to [i]me[/i] about forgiveness? Have you any inkling of knowing what it's like to be like this? Alone? Forgotten? Dangling around for all to see, and no one to help?

More then... More then you know...




And then what

1. Luna always strikes me as the one who believed that, for the good of society, there must be A Line between the rulership and the population. Ironically, this may have added to her pre-Nightmare isolation, and it may have taken that thousand-year timeout plus returning to find herself devoid of the power structures she'd devised to break her out of that mindset.
    
2. ### _[_21:29_]_Logarithmicon_:_¬†
    
    Even that probably wasn't the best way to do it, but it did mean that she was finally forced to actually open up socially to individuals as an individuals, rather than as A Ruler. But it does explain a lot of her initial awkwardness.

### 21:26_]_Forcalor_:_¬†

Kinda envisioned this scene right now, where she submerges into deepest waters. Alicorns seemingly fine in _space_, so why not

My light was always just reflection of your own.



Even light of my precious Moon is not my own...

"Do you... even love them?"

"Please, enough... It hurts me..."

How can she be so...

"Are you siding with those ingrates!?"
"No, I..."
"Then step aside, and let divine justice reign!"

"If they are not happy, then I'm not happy. Don't you understand that simple idea?"


"What manner of creature is it?"

"A kirin, your majesty."

"A [i]kirin[/i]?" She laughed, "What a beautiful toy! What can it do?"


I hoped I could force these feelings out and power it through.


Sadness creates more sadness.


What does it matter? You are long dead.

Will we meet in the dreams?


A favor for you, Celestia.

She never visits her alone. It is forbidden.

"You are no Sister of mine, Celestia."

She is majestic, anyway.

She spoke solemnly

"Everything will be over soon, Luna."

in more or less poetic ways
well, in this interpretation it seems to be 'predetermined future'. Marks easy to see as something that is slapped on you and begins correcting your course going on forward, with waning special talents when they are removed, all that shtick. I'm sure ponies would've looked at it this way, at least some of them, just be mostly chill about it

It is easy to forget about dead.

"Did you really expect me to sit idly by, while they all basked in your precious light!?" Luna was going on with her speech, as she proceeded to climb up the tribune that they used to address the subjects. A symbol meant to represent their equal status as alicorns.

Cadance sighed, cutted her off in stentorian voice: "A while back, Celestia told me that the Elements might be the last hope for Equestria. She made me make promise, that if unexpected happen and things go sour, I'll try to preserve you. I am not about to squander this hope."

Cadance glanced around, then turned to her ponies. A little voice in back of her head noted that she is mimicking Celestia's posture, with spreaded wings and slightly lifted foreleg. Seems it definitely became like a second nature to her.
