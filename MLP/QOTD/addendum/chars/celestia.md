Of course, the queens of Canina are right, Celestia's responses to some of the more recent threats to Equestria are wanting, but that doesn't mean that she's a failure; any action that we take in this world of imperfection and contingency will have areas where it can be improved. What matters is that Celestia's willing to learn, and she does appear to be, even if the main thing she learns is just how capable Twilight is. But to those who call her a failure, or for her to step down, I have but one reply, a simple question; "**Could you do better?**" Discord is The Crawling Chaos, Sombra a warlord of devastating power and inventiveness, Chrysalis an enemy who you can never see coming, and in a magical world like Equestria, Tirek is basically a walking Armageddon. What can political leaders do to fight Ragnarok? I'm not saying Celestia's perfect, but I am saying she's one of the world's best shots, and will remain so until Twilight manages to grow into her role.
