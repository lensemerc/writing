element of empathy

начинает упоминать Бога после трансформации

Creatures like you are imperative to bring the balance


Sunset is an empath
Well, that's cool powerset to keep in mind while writing her pov, especially coupled with engineer-like approach to all things magical. Would love to explore it
### 18:17_]_Forcalor_:_ 

What are Sunset's flaws except for her feeling of inadequacy before Princessess, anyway?
### 18:17_]_LurksNoMore_:_ 

Temper. Pride. Ruthlessness.

1. ### _[_18:46_]_EileenSaysHi_:_ 
    
    Sunset’s a newly minted telepath coming off a harsh, well-learned lesson in respecting boundaries. It makes sense she develops control over making sure she only uses that power deliberately and with a purpose in mind.

    Appropriate use case: Determining if Wallflower is wielding a dangerous magical artifact and weaponizing it against her and her friends Inappropriate use case: Figuring out if Twilight’s lying to be polite about enjoying her cooking (изменено)

1.  Sunset is very similar, and is always trying to charge herself with the responsibility of helping out wherever she can. But when it comes time to ask for help, she wants to be able to do it on her own. (изменено)

1. ### 19:55_]_Magnanimous_:_ 
    
    Both of them afraid of regressing.
    
2. ### _[_19:55_]_Magnanimous_:_ 
    
    Both of them afraid of growing and changing.

repatriate
1. To restore or return to the country of birth, citizenship, or origin.
2. To restore to one's own country.

### 23:11_]_gapty_:_ 

I would say that Sunset is confident, a little rebellious (doing graffity paintings), having rage issues (as when she plays video games or freaking out in Rollercoaster), but at the same time she's the most mature of the Rainbooms

### 23:11_]_Abi.gail_:_ 

She broke away from princess Celestia to pursue a destiny of her own design, and was not afraid to assert her will over the kids of Canterlot High She’s very confident in herself and not afraid to tell someone no

### 23:13_]_Abi.gail_:_ 

To me she feels like the kind of person you can talk to about just about anything


1. ### _[_16:28_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Does she physically gets the Element in her series?
### 16:29_]_Tempest56_:_ 

Sunset does, yes. And instantly goes nuts.
