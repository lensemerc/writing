После поверапа магия сансет становится teal-red-orange

начинает упоминать Бога после трансформации

    do Sunset even have this kind of chemistry with anyone else?
    1. ### _[_21:52_]_Vinylshadow_:_ 
    
    not to _this_ degree with anyone else, no not as blatent or intentional
    
2. ### _[_21:52_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    I see

какой-то из фильмов с Сансет и Пинки где они застряли в тайм лупе

I love that Finn basically "inherit" some of his father senility and antisocial behavior with the caring and empathic philosophy of his brother Jake, that also took care of him. He is basically a violent empathic.

They did such a good job with Adult Finn. He absolutely WOULD be the kinda guy at this point in his life who'd just walk up and inject himself into a conversation like this.

The one thing I point to in her consistent traits is that her _ego_ never goes away. Sure she tries to help others after reforming, but if you watch? It's all about her. "How do _I_ fix this." "_I_ have to do this." "If _I_ don't figure out how magic works, what happens is _my_ fault."

    Even that diminishes as time goes on. One thing that’s always struck me about later EqG is that Sunset doesn’t really try to position herself as “the leader” of the Rainbooms in-universe and is perfectly willing to let others take point.

    Wow, that's great observation. I think I've leaned into something similar in my interpretation... Will add to my notes, that is good (изменено)
    
3. ### _[_18:18_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Well, not in unhealthy way, just a strong sense of self and independence (изменено)

    It does, but it never really goes away entirely. It isn't helped by her frankly severe case of Protaganism.

    _Forgotten Friendship_ and _Sunset’s Backstage Pass_ are both situations basically engineered to force her to act independently (which works better in the latter than the former imo)

Sunset is an empath
Well, that's cool powerset to keep in mind while writing her pov, especially coupled with engineer-like approach to all things magical. Would love to explore it
### 18:17_]_Forcalor_:_ 

What are Sunset's flaws except for her feeling of inadequacy before Princessess, anyway?
### 18:17_]_LurksNoMore_:_ 

Temper. Pride. Ruthlessness.

1. ### _[_18:46_]_EileenSaysHi_:_ 
    
    Sunset’s a newly minted telepath coming off a harsh, well-learned lesson in respecting boundaries. It makes sense she develops control over making sure she only uses that power deliberately and with a purpose in mind.

    Appropriate use case: Determining if Wallflower is wielding a dangerous magical artifact and weaponizing it against her and her friends Inappropriate use case: Figuring out if Twilight’s lying to be polite about enjoying her cooking (изменено)

1.  Sunset is very similar, and is always trying to charge herself with the responsibility of helping out wherever she can. But when it comes time to ask for help, she wants to be able to do it on her own. (изменено)

    Both of them afraid of regressing.
    
2. ### _[_19:55_]_Magnanimous_:_ 
    
    Both of them afraid of growing and changing.

repatriate
1. To restore or return to the country of birth, citizenship, or origin.
2. To restore to one's own country.

### 23:11_]_gapty_:_ 

I would say that Sunset is confident, a little rebellious (doing graffity paintings), having rage issues (as when she plays video games or freaking out in Rollercoaster), but at the same time she's the most mature of the Rainbooms

### 23:11_]_Abi.gail_:_ 

She broke away from princess Celestia to pursue a destiny of her own design, and was not afraid to assert her will over the kids of Canterlot High She’s very confident in herself and not afraid to tell someone no

### 23:13_]_Abi.gail_:_ 

To me she feels like the kind of person you can talk to about just about anything


1. ### _[_16:28_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Does she physically gets the Element in her series?
### 16:29_]_Tempest56_:_ 

Sunset does, yes. And instantly goes nuts.

    Fanon based changeling reading of emotions and Sunset’s canon powers of empathy seem to function almost identically.
    
2. ### _[_4:07_]_hawthornbunny_:_ 
    
    Do they? I thought the changeling emotional sense was usually equated to something like smell or taste, while Sunset's power is that she touches people and sees their memories
    
    
    ### _[_4:12_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    About 'seeing memories' part, I think the show tried to represent Sunset experiencing the same as her victim did.
    
6. @Vinylshadow
    
    kinda want to write a changeling that goes "of _course_ we eat food. Emotion doesn't have any nutritional value. Why on earth do you think we don't _eat_."
    
    
7. ### _[_4:16_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Like, 'oh yeah, you're _that_ kind of person, you'd do that', and then her struggling mindscape pulls her into the movie where she watches the ongoing scene for a few seconds, while in reality she experiences a momentarily 'eureka!' moment (изменено)
    
8. ### _[_4:19_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    You might say she _daydreams_ for a moment. yeah, that's good
