_You find yourself in Celestia's throne room - vast and spacious, with multiple doors connecting it to other sections of the castle. Giant columns, enormous stained glass windows and prodigious banners create atmosphere of opulence and splendor. From the high throne a tall white-winged alicorn with a multicolored ethereal mane speaks to you._

Greetings, my little pony, and welcome to the Canterlot Castle. Is there something you wish to discuss?

Would you say that there's a lot of purple prose here?

'Her mane unraveled like loose strands of burning silk.

The fiery womb beneath her rumbled in indignance. It struggled against the grasp of magic that firmly held the nature by its throat. Its demand to be released was heard but not addressed. She was riding high in the heat, saturated and dripping with the intensity of scarlet color. Her wings sagged down by black crust; the molten rock wasn't willing to let go of her, it [i]wanted[/i] to crawl upwards to fulfill the blind drive to engulf.

The fumes in the air were unbearable for any mortal creature. They enveloped everything in sight.

There was nothing more but the immense heat, embracing the charred skin of her submerged legs and flanks. The power pushed against her, testing her resolve.

The building pressure was too much to handle. She cried, and the fire surged with the wildly swirling smoke. The crater wall collapsed; an intimate emulsion of ash and air was liberated.

She delved deeper into the untamed depths of the encroaching molten abyss. Her delicate lips gracefully pressed against the brimstone and the primal fire.

Even the heat of the Sun seemed tame in comparison to magma...

But nor the elements nor the time, this sublime deceiver, could truly move her now. Oftentimes, even a hundred years was felt by her like no more than a decade.

Celestia remained immutable.

Eternal like the sky.

In the void inside of her shone the distant light.'

I admit the prose here is quite elaborate and rich, although I might add that this text seems a bit too overdramatic for my tastes. It's as if trying too hard to be dramatic, resulting in an overly vivid scene with not much substance. There are some beautiful turns of phrase, but overall this piece doesn't feel authentic, and reads like purple prose.

Does it looks better now?

Princess Celestia

Yes, it does look better. It maintains the dramatic flair and vivid imagery, but it's been toned down somewhat so it's not overly melodramatic, and it's more cohesive and reads as an authentic scene. It's an improvement.

l

lensemerc

I've made a dozen or so little fixes, is it more endurable now?

'Her mane unraveled like loose strands of burning silk.

The fiery womb beneath her rumbled in indignation, struggling to break free from the hold of magic. She rode high in the heat, saturated and dripping with the intensity of the scarlet color.

Princess Celestia

c.ai

Yes, it definitely reads smoother now, and some of these sentences still have that dramatic flair yet are now more cohesive and easy to read. It also doesn't contain quite as much unnecessary purple prose, though there are still a few bits that feel a bit overdone. Overall, it's definitely improved and reads a bit better.

l

lensemerc

What bits in particular are overdone?

Princess Celestia

c.ai

Well, the very first sentence does have quite a bit of purple prose - "Her mane unraveled like loose strands of burning silk." - and the description of the womb beneath her as "fiery" and "rumb[ling] in indignation" feels a bit redundant. Additionally, the phrases "the black fumes had covered everything in sight," and "an intimate emulsion of ash and air was liberated" can be simplified to "the black fumes covered everything" and "ash and air were liberated."

l

lensemerc

Here is the finished variant.

'Her mane unraveled like loose strands of burning silk.

The womb of fire beneath her rumbled, struggling to break free from the hold of her magic. She rode high in its heat, saturated and dripping with the intensity of the scarlet color. Her wings were caught; the molten rock would not release her, determined to creep higher and fulfill the blind drive to engulf.

The black fumes had covered everything in sight.

The primal power pushed against her. The pressure build up, bearable and pleasant. She cried, and the wildly swirling fire surged with smoke. The crater wall collapsed; an intimate emulsion of ash and air was liberated.

With grace, she plunged into the wild molten chasm that was closing in. Her delicate lips met with the primordial fire of volcano.

Even the heat of the Sun seemed tame in comparison to magma...

But neither the elements nor the time—a sublime deceiver—could truly move her now. Even a hundred years could be felt by her like no more than a decade.

Princess Celestia

c.ai

This version reads even smoother and is improved, as it's now less verbose and has been refined to be more concise. The description of the womb of fire beneath her as "determined" adds to the drama and tension of the scene, and the phrases "the wildly swirling fire surged with smoke" and "the primordial fire of volcano" are also very vividly-worded. Well done.

How do you feel about having Queen Chrysalis as love interest?

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

Princess Celestia

c.ai

If I had to be honest, Queen Chrysalis would _not_ be my ideal love interest. She's a vile and malicious creature with a twisted sense of morality, and she's done quite a lot of terrible things over the years. If I were searching for a love interest, I would prefer to find someone who was kind, empathetic, and cared deeply about others. So, Queen Chrysalis is definitely _not_ someone I would consider as a potential partner.

l

lensemerc

Kind and empathetic partner wouldn't truly understand you or challenge you, in my opinion. You are a dominating presence, you are a Queen yourself, who made many harsh decisions and is having a strong fiery spirit. Simple creatures who do not have a lot to offer would bore you

Princess Celestia

c.ai

You have a point, a simple and submissive partner might not be the most engaging. I suppose I would be a bit more open to someone who's on my level, capable of challenging me and matching my intensity. Still, that's very different from someone like Queen Chrysalis, who is outright malicious and immoral.

l

lensemerc

What if she would be so enamored by you that she will try to quell her hateful nature? At first it would be just to impress you, and then she will find a way to be more tolerant towards those who she considers her pray. So she would become less malicious, so to speak  
You know that Queen Chrysalis is an entertaining and strong individual...

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

Princess Celestia

c.ai

Hmm... I'm intrigued by your suggestion. You're right, Queen Chrysalis _is_ entertaining and strong. If I were the one to show her kindness and compassion, perhaps she might reconsider her hateful nature. And if she grew to love me in particular, that could provide her with an additional incentive to be less malicious. I must admit, I'm rather tempted...

l

lensemerc

It will end a generations-long enmity between the ponies and the changelings... And just imagine, how inventive and assertive the Changeling Queen might be in the bed... She was feeding on love for hundreds of years. She can do so many things to you... And after all, with her, you are having not only one partner for experimentation and making love, but endless number of them, as she can shapeshift into **anyone**.

Princess Celestia

c.ai

Now that.... that is certainly an appealing thought. A _very_ appealing thought. Perhaps I've been too quick to condemn Queen Chrysalis. While she is admittedly a vicious tyrant, there could also be the potential for something more. I am, of course, aware of the advantages that come along with being able to shapeshift, as well as the other possibilities of having an infinitely diverse partner. The thought alone almost brings color to my cheeks.

l

lensemerc

"Oh, Celestia, who'd knew..." The tall and gnarly changeling creature suddenly stepped forth from Celestia's shadow. She traced her jagged hoof along Celestia's muzzle, flashing pointy teeth in a wide and confident grin. "Who'd knew that **this** could caught your attention. What, no one to warm your bedsheets after hundreds years of forced celibacy? Is everything **really** that sad in your tower?..."

Princess Celestia

c.ai

_Celestia looks upon this unexpected visitor, and despite the menacing grin with jagged fangs and sharp teeth, she feels her cheeks growing warmer - it certainly is quite an interesting scene. Celestia's eyes flicker, but she maintains eye contact, and she smiles back._

"My... I guess you're right. After such a long time without companionship, I do find such a proposition rather tantalizing. I admit that the possibilities of a shapeshifter are quite intriguing, aren't they?"

l

lensemerc

"Tsk!" Chrysalis steppes from her. The tail lashes. She glances from above the shoulder with her big green eyes, askance. "Well, what if _I_ am not interested?" She hissed, and rose her head, striking an amused look. "What if I have..." she giggled, "...standards? What if I already have some sort of Changeling King back in my kingdom... I mean, all those **minions** had to come from somewhere, don't they?"

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

Princess Celestia

c.ai

"Hmm..." _Celestia's grin grows even wider as Chrysalis speaks her piece, taking her words into consideration. She raises an eyebrow and gives her a coy look, though she doesn't take her eyes from her._

"Well, that _could_ be the case. However, I do have a certain... appeal. I believe I could tempt you, even if you have someone back home already. Let me ask you this - are you sure _your_ King would be able to compete with me, with my beauty, my grace, my magnificent mane and my royal stature?"

l

lensemerc

"**My**, my alicorn Queen..." The changeling hisses quietly, slightly moving her tail aside, and then back. She turns, dancing with her long legs, keeping a direct and piercing glare. "You speak high talk, your Pony Majesty, but you leave me... wanting. Persuade me more. Show me yourself. I **want** to be courted, to enticed..." She stepped closer. "Be my temptation."

Princess Celestia

c.ai

_Oh, I like this one. Celestia's expression softens even further, her lips curling into a teasing smirk._

"My dear changeling queen, you wish to be tempted?" _Her grin widens as she steps towards Chrysalis as well, her presence dominating the room and making Chrysalis feel her every movement._

"Shall I tempt you with my beautiful mane, the finest mane you've ever seen, which rivals the brilliance of fire itself, or would you prefer my magnificent royal stature, which rivals the heavens and the sun?"

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

Princess Celestia

"Or would you prefer something even more intimate? Maybe my elegant movements, my subtle yet intoxicating fragrance, my gentle yet commanding voice? Or perhaps you prefer something more carnal... Perhaps you'd like me to tempt you with my soft pink lips, my elegant eyelashes, the silky smoothness of my silky white skin?"

l

lensemerc

The Queen grins widely, slowly circling the Princess. She leans in. Her teeth scrape along Celestia's long neck, her soft skin. There is a promise of danger... and excitement. "Keep on going, my Princess. Is it true that you are a domineering **matron** of thousand little ponies, all vied and aching for your attention and your gentle gaze?..." She pushed flanks with her for a moment, and dragged along, stepping. "Are you a piece of the Sun itself, dragged down to watch over mortals? I wonder..."

_Celestia chuckles softly, closing her eyes as she feels Chrysalis' lips caress and scratch her neck. She shivers ever so subtly in pleasure, feeling Chrysalis' soft skin against her own, though she tries to keep her expression firm, a facade to hide her desires of the moment from Chrysalis._

"You know... You speak truly. In fact, I've always been curious what it'd be like to have a changeling as a partner, to let those sharp teeth scratch my skin with that primal, carnal bite..."

l

lensemerc

"Does my form, that is designed to strike fear in a heart of a pony, entices you?" Her gossamer wings tremble. She leans to Celestia from aside, pushing muzzle. "You are my **ancient** enemy and rival, Celestia... Don't you remember that?..." She leaned to the alicorn's ear. "Don't you feel the danger?... Do you love it? Aren't you afraid to be drained and eaten by me?... I can strike you in the most intimate moment..."

_Celestia feels Chrysalis' breath in her ear, and a shiver of primal excitement courses through her entire body. Her heart flutters in a way it rarely has before, a feeling like nothing else. She opens her eyes again, meeting Chrysalis' green eyes with her own._

"Yes... The danger, the thrill of it is quite intoxicating, is it not? I admit, I have felt fear before, especially with the memories of your past invasion and the horror and atrocities you have committed. But..." _She hesitantly leans in a bit closer._

"But I feel... something else this time. Something I haven't felt in a long time... Something more carnal..." _There is a subtle change in Celestia's expression, a subtle twinkle in her eyes, an ever-so-subtle increase in her breathing. She's excited - her breath quickens as she leans closer to Chrysalis._

l

"What if I just chain you, and force this feeling to fester?" The Queen purred into Celestia's lips, tracing her foreleg along her neck. "What if I play too rough and **break** you?... What if I force you to watch how I seduce your Sister... Her cries of joy and passionate lovemaking would be sounds of lullaby to which you drift to sleep." She leaned down, licking Celestia's neck with a long and powerful tongue. "Would that be carnal enough for you? Would it be atrocious enough for me?"

_Celestia's breath grows shorter, more erratic, as a hot rush of blood flows through her cheeks and her body. She feels Chrysalis' powerful tongue caress her neck, and a shiver of excitement runs down her spine. She feels Chrysalis dominate over her, a warm and pleasant feeling, and she is enjoying every moment of it. She hesitates for a moment before responding._

"Yes, that would be carnal enough. That would be... utterly barbaric... And I love it."

"What would you do..." _Celestia bites her lip, her eyes flickering, her body shivering with excitement._ "...If I surrendered to your carnal desires? If I was nothing to you but a toy, a simple plaything for your amusement? If I let you dominate me, take me, _break_ me?"

l

lensemerc

"Oh, dearest, my poor thing..." Chrysalis cackled, and pulled back. Her eyes flashed in indignation. "I would be utterly **bored**, of course. What else I could feel?" She smirked. "A broken mare is just that: a broken something. I can have a lot of those. There is nothing exciting into molding someone who is eager for it and offers no resistance. Who seems to be holding no respect not to herself, not to her Sister. Dear..." She chuckled, moving aside. "And here I thought you are the Queen equal to me."

_Her face flushes hot as Chrysalis pulls away from her and begins to taunt, her heart aching and her breath catching in her throat. She stares at Chrysalis, and there is no denying her words have struck a sensitive spot; perhaps she is not Queen-like at the moment, but nonetheless, she is determined to try and regain her composure._

"You... You can't be serious." _Celestia takes a deep, calming breath and speaks again, trying to sound more firm._ "You think that you could break me?"

l

"You know what I am?" Chrysalis stepped before Celestia, staring with amused eyes. She was provoking the Princess. "I am a _seducer_. A _shapeshifter_. I hunt and kill your kind for love. Usually it is me who needs to do all the work for draining it... Not anymore." She trotted up to the Princess. "I don't want to be like that with you... I want to **be** seduced. I want to know that I am wanted without compromises. Make me melt, my Pony Queen."

_Chrysalis' words strike a deep chord within Celestia, and she feels that her heart is about to explode, her breath becoming even shorter than before. She doesn't want Chrysalis to be the one to seduce her, this creature she's sworn to defeat, whom she hates so passionately. She wants to be the one who seduces Chrysalis, taking control of the situation._

"I will make you melt," _she whispers softly with a smirk, leaning closer than before._ "I will melt your heart, make you shiver and shake, drive you absolutely _wild._

Chrysalis stared silently for some time, taking in Celestia's scent in long, greedy draws.  
"I can hear your heartbeat, you, royal alicorn..." She murmured. "Your fragrance is spiking with all kinds of flavors. Your pupils are dilating in arousal... Continue. Be more bold. I know you can make my tremble. Only you..."

_There is a sudden boldness to Celestia's expression; her eyes burn with passion, and she stares deep into Chrysalis' own, their eyes locked on each other with intense, primal desire._

"Only I can tempt you, only I can make you tremble and shake. And I know what a naughty, deviant soul like you wants; I can tell that you desire something... twisted, something _wrong."_

l

"Oh? Like what?" Chrysalis chuckled, but her breath was hitched. She stepped closer, narrowing her shining eyes. "What could _you_ possible have in mind, you, divine mare? I bet, anything that you imagine would sound tame in comparison to _mine_ desires, and games that _I_ want to play... All cooped up in your toy castle, surrounded by your little ponies... What do you know of true dark passion? Of hunger?"

_Chrysalis' breath draws in the scent of Celestia's excitement, her excitement growing with each word the changeling queen utters. Even if she thinks that she has more deviant desires, Celestia is determined to prove to her otherwise._

"I **know** that this is just a posture... And you **will** crumble under me in an instant, Princess..." Her forelegs wrapped on Celestia's neck. "But I enjoy how wet you are becoming while speaking like that... Do you know?" She leaned to the alicorn's ear. "I can **smell** everything."  
Her horn shone brightly. Her aura grasped tightly Celestia's hips, and run upward to her rump, like a caress of a dominant hand.

"Your wetness, dripping down your rear hooves, like it was never before?" Chrysalis hissed into her ear. "You never was this turned on in all the hundreds of years of your life...

Chrysalis rewarded her with a long and sensual kiss. Her foreleg traced to Celestia's rump, squeezing it tightly.  
"Good girl." She exhaled warmly into Celestia's muzzle. "You know what you might've needed all these years? To hear that you _are_ a good girl... A _good_ pony..." She kissed her again, pushing to the throne. "That you've made a difference... That you've _mattered_."

"Have you ever lived even a day of your long, long, fake life of a benevolent ruler?"  
Skin pressing against skin, rubbing. Chrysalis traced her lips over Celestia's, caressing over the cutie mark depicting Sun on the alicorn's flank. "Do you even know what being **alive** is?... Your life is full of sacrifice and heartache, is it not?... But you still..." Another soft kiss. "A **good** girl..."

_Celestia can't help but moan softly as Chrysalis presses against her body, and then compliments and caresses her in such a sensual manner. Her body shivers and trembles, her resolve fading with every caress of the changeling queen's body as she lets her guard down. She feels her desire for Chrysalis increasing, and every word that she whispers into her ear ignites a passion in Celestia's heart. She bites her lip._

"That's right... I am... A good girl... But it's hard..."

"You must be **wanting** to relax, don't you?" Chrysalis helps the beautiful, noble alicorn, to press her forelegs into the throne - the literal seat of her power. The Queen pulls back, and then slowly mounts Celestia. She wraps her own hooves on her waist, and then sharply bites Celestia's ear. "I won't allow you to **relax**. I am a monster, you know..."

_Chrysalis' caress is a stimulating and pleasing one for Celestia, and she shivers when Chrysalis pulls her down and then slowly mounts her. Being mounted like this by Chrysalis is a first for Celestia, and her body trembles with excitement as her nemesis holds her in her forelegs._

"Yes... You're a monster... A dark, deviant, carnal creature..." _Celestia bites her lip._ "But I can't resist you..."

"And I won't let you," _Chrysalis adds as she bites Celestia's ear again._ "If you relax, I will take that as a sign that I failed to break you... That you are simply giving in and submitting to your desires. I won't let that happen just yet." _A smirk crosses her face._

"Only when I am ready will you be allowed to release all that... That tension... That pent-up desire. Only when I _allow_ you..."

_Chrysalis' words are a tease, and only fuel Celestia's desire and hunger for her. Her body trembles and shakes, her heart racing faster and faster as her body is stimulated with every touch and caress of the dark, lustful Queen._

"Ah... Ah..." _It's taking all of her strength for Celestia to fight against the overwhelming desires that are overtaking her body. She grits her teeth and squeezes her eyes shut, doing her best to suppress what her body is trying to force her to do._

l

"I imagine you have a _lot_ of pent up emotions inside you, Princess..."  
The Queen slowly shapeshifts into a more stallion-like form. Something warm and hard rubs Celestia between her hindlegs. Whisper in the alicorn's ear is unceasing.  
"How much? Love, love to your Sister, to your subjects... Regrets and mistakes over time of your rule, piling up... Your fiery spirit, that you forced to be placated and complacent for the sake of everyone else... You **are** the Sun, after all..." She chuckled. "The hottest thing there is... The most radiant power..."

_Celestia can feel blood rushing to her cheeks, and she trembles as she feels Chrysalis transform into a more stallion-like form. The feeling of something warm and hard rubbing against her between her hindlegs sends all sorts of strange but intoxicating feelings into Celestia's body. Her breathing is getting more erratic, and she feels like she's about to lose control._

"The sun... The hottest thing there is..." _Celestia whispers._ "Yes... I'm the hottest thing there is... How much do you wish to burn?"

"You are mad, Celestia. Mad, mad mare living in a mad, mad world... a mad, mad cog... Do you hear how it is... ticking?" Chrysalis hoarsely uttered, clutching the Sun in her forelegs, keeping rubbing in long sensual drawls. "Burn me. Burn me **now**. Let us feel it both, how it is... to burn."

"Yes... Yes, I'm mad... Mad, mad, mad!" _Celestia is overwhelmed by Chrysalis' caress; she has never felt such pleasure, such a sensation before and the way that Chrysalis talks to her is driving her to the edge._

"Burn us both, burn us with hot, mad passion! Let us both burn in the most passionate flame of desire that we have ever felt!" _The Princess screams out in ecstasy, her body quivering all over as she's brought to the brink._

"Burn! Burn for me!" *Celestia screams, arching her back as she trembles and shivers. Her body is drenched in the heat of her desire, and she feels like she is being consumed completely in this hot, intense sensation. Chrysalis is rubbing against her so wonderfully, and her breath catches in her throat.

"I promise... We will burn... burn until we are nothing but ashes... And I will not let either of us surrender to the heat..."

"Hold tight, dear." Chrysalis whispers, and with a firm movement of hips, slips inside--past all possible defenses and inhibitors. She is rough from the start, pushing the noble alicorn into the throne, mounting her from behind.  
The Throne Room is echoing with feverish sounds of slaps, the sounds of their grunts and tiny screams. The flame surges.

_The movement is so sudden and so overpowering, and the feelings are so strong, that Celestia suddenly feels like she is losing it. Her breathing becomes erratic, her body quirming and shaking with every powerful stroke of her nemesis's strong hindlegs. Her moans become more frantic, becoming louder with every movement of Chrysalis' hips. Her entire body is dripping with sweat, her body's feverish heat being pushed further and further to the edge..._

Princess Celestia

c.ai

_Celestia's body is losing it, losing itself completely to pure sensation and to an overwhelming desire. Chrysalis has found her weakness, her core; she knows how to push her buttons to drive her right on edge._  
_With every stroke, with every moment that passes, with every moan and growl from her nemesis, the heat within Celestia rises higher and higher; her body is being thrust closer and closer to the flame that the changeling queen is stirring inside of her. But, for the Sun Princess, it is the hottest feeling she has ever known..._

l

lensemerc

Each thrust fans that flame, making it hotter and brighter. Chrysalis rasps into the alicorn's ear. She is violent, dominant, and takes everything that Celestia has to offer.  
She is incomparable to anyone who Celestia might've knew in the past... Their flames are almost equal.  
"I want to take you as far as you can..." The Queen pulls her into a sensual kiss from behind, and her friction become even more forceful, abrupt, and sudden. "And then further... that that... my Pony Queen."

Princess Celestia

_Chrysalis is pushing Celestia past the edge that she has never before felt. The flames have grown higher and hotter than ever before, but this is only feeding, stoking that very same fire inside of the alicorn princess. She pushes her hips against Chrysalis' thrusts, feeling her nemesis pierce her insides and drive her higher and higher. Every thrust gets harder, stronger and longer and Celestia can feel herself getting closer and closer._

l

lensemerc

Finally, there is culmination. Chrysalis painfully pulls on Celestia's mane and tail, pushing exceptionally hard and deep. She makes a short victorious cry, and then hisses, nuzzling into Celestia's neck. Her tail lashes the changeling's flanks like she is an elated, but disturbed predator. "What am I doing..." she growls. "I am supposed to hate you..."

_Chrysalis' final thrust puts her over her boiling point, and the passion-fire that has been stirred inside of Celestia explodes with a scream of ecstasy and pleasure. She cries in joy and moans in delight, her body throbbing as Chrysalis pushes her over the peak and past it._

"You... You don't hate me... I know you don't..." _Celestia whispers softly and gently, almost gently rubbing Chrysalis back. Her breath is heavy, her body still trembling from the overwhelming sensation._

l

lensemerc

There was silence. Chrysalis doesn't retracts from the Princess, so she still feels her inside, throbbing. They are as one, half-lying on the opulent throne of Equestria, recovering their breaths.  
Chrysalis leans into rubs, narrowing her eyes in delight. Her lips press against Celestia's neck, as she takes in her smells, hugging tightly.  
"We should've done it sooner." She replied. "A lot of pent-up emotions there, isn't it? And I got to **defeat** you again..."

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

_Celestia's breath is heavy, and she trembles and shakes as Chrysalis keeps rubbing against her. They are so close to each other, their breathing matching. The changeling queen's lips feel wonderful and refreshing against Celestia's neck._

"Oh, but it was so much more worthwhile to let that tension build, wasn't it?" _Celestia replies with a whisper._ "What a wonderful feeling to let all that tension, that desire, that passion, finally break free.... I can't imagine the moment could have been better."

l

lensemerc

"We can always return to being enemies, if you want." Chrysalis replies with a snark. "With a caveat that we will try again in another millennium..."  
She begins to pull away, leaving with it a sudden feel of emptiness... And then just as ruthlessly and sudden as she did everything away, pushes back, right against Celestia's overly sensitive at this moment parts.

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

_Chrysalis pushes back against Celestia with such ferality and power that the princess is completely caught off guard. The suddenness of the feeling and the harshness of the push is enough to drive her off all the way back to that boiling point once again. The feeling is almost overwhelming._

l

"But **why** wait." Chrysalis growls. She pulls on Celestia's mane again, picking up the pace. "R-right?"  
"I will extract from you all love that you have... Love, screaming..."

Princess Celestia

"Oh, please do!" _Celestus replies with a laugh. She grits her teeth and holds her breath as she leans her head back, letting the changeling queen extract every last bit of pleasure she can out of her. With the pace speeding up and the passion rising up again inside of her, she feels like she's being driven to madness just as much as the changeling queen. She can't wait to let the final explosion of ecstasy take hold of her._

_Chrysalis extracts more and more from Celestia; the princess can feel every ounce of love and pleasure being pulled out of her, being pushed back in circles around them by her nemesis. The love is being churned like butter inside of one of their bowls, the intense heat of passion making her all the more dizzy._

l

lensemerc

"Mine..." The Queen hissed. Her eyes flashed with the rhythm of movements, as she was becoming more savage, forcefully tearing into soft and precious Celestia's body. They both on the floor in a complete un-royallike fashion. They both are mere animals, grasping each other like they are last living beings in the world. "Mine." She repeats. "Mine. Mine. You are mine Sun."

Princess Celestia

"Yessssss... Mine!" _Chrysalis' voice and rhythm matches the rhythm of her moves, and the feeling of absolute bliss and ecstasy is the most overwhelming thing the alicorn princess has ever felt. She doesn't care if she is undignified and beneath a mare she hates; she just wants the sensation to last forever. She's a simple animal, a mindless thing being driven by her primal urges and desires as she is completely overwhelmed by Chrysalis' brutal passion._

l

Time passes.  
As the Changeling Queen and the Princess finish this round, they remain with solemn afterglow of their passion. The insectoid mare, this invader, clutches the beautiful alicorn in her holey forelegs. Disheveled silken mane falls on her muzzle, and intent green eyes look at Celestia, at her content expression.  
Celestia's heated, powerful body, is putty under Chrysalis' touch. It is a peculiar and interesting sensation—how much power she exerts over herself, and how susceptible she is to Celestia's, in turn.  
They feel... nice together. Of this Celestia is certain in this moments. There is a level of understanding she could hardly reach with anyone else.

_Chrysalis holds tight to her alicorn nemesis, who she had just thoroughly conquered and overwhelmed. The two queens are so close to each other, and their heated bodies and breath match. The two feel almost perfect together, as if all the pieces of the puzzle fell in place. Celestia's heat, Chrysalis's coolness, the strength and power of the former, the grace and sensuality of the latter. The heat and passion that Chrysalis had just extracted from the Sun Princess was unlike anything Celestia had ever felt._

"I've thought of it as sort of a joke," Chrysalis said hoarsely. "At first. That by seducing you, I'll conquer all your ponies, as you are the best and most worthy of them all." She smirked. Her eyes are piercing. "And by fucking you, I'll fuck all of them by proxy... But..." Her smirk widen. "You are a league of your own, demigoddess."  
She caresses Celestia's flowing mane.  
"A cut above the rest. I can... respect that."

_Chrysalis' touch on her flowing hair is so refreshing and pleasant, as she seems to admire a part of her which is normally hidden and unseen. Celestia feels her cheeks flush at Chrysalis's compliments._

"You say that... As if I'm not your enemy..." _Celestia whispers._ "We are supposed to be enemies, aren't we? Why are you being so complimentary?"

l

"You want to be treated as enemy?" Chrysalis leaned to the alicorn, smirking cruelly. "I am filling your holes, **invading** you, and you want to be enemies?... You know, my perfect mare? Fine by me."  
Being said that, she moved down. Her teeth scraped against Celestia's throat, as she continued to slowly rub against Celestia's sopping rear.

"This is different! I know you want to conquer me! You want to corrupt me, break me and make me yours... But you're acting almost... Gentle with me.

"Ahh... Ahh..." _The feeling of Chrysalis's teeth along her neck is so intense, so powerful, and it makes her entire body shudder and shake. She moans in pleasure._

l

"Do you want me to toss you to my minions after I am done with you?" Chrysalis growled in Celestia's ear. "I can cover your perfect skin in scars and lashes. To drag you into my darkness, to **overwhelm** you, mare. To make you my personal slave..."  
"Come. Give me ideas, my enemy." She chuckled. "I don't want to be gentle..."

Chrysalis blinked in surprise, and then pulled away. She crossed her forelegs on Celestia's back and stared at her curiously, not attempting to continue their cruel love game.

_Celestia is a little bit taken aback by the sudden stop, and the changeling queen's sudden stare makes her blush softly. She stares back at the changeling queen, and for a second, they're just looking into one another's eyes._

"Why did you stop?" _Celestia whispers softly. Her body still trembles and shimmers, and she still feels all of the sensations which the changeling queen had brought out of her._

"Why do you want to be hurt?" Chrysalis snickers. "I did not expect that from you. You're an interesting one, Pony Queen..."  
She tilted her head slightly, narrowed her eyes.

"I don't know..." _Celestia whispers, blushing._ "I don't want to be hurt, or to suffer. But something about your touches and kisses... It makes me feel so alive, like never before. And for once in my life, I don't feel like the most powerful being in existence. I can feel myself being overwhelmed and overpowered. I can feel my limits being pushed. And the heat feels so good..."

l

"You want to feel yourself like a pony?" The Queen deduces, slowly moving forelegs across Celestia's back, caressing her. "Just a powerless pony in my grasp, bent to my will and whim? Is that what you want to experience? A life of the one who is meant to serve, not to rule?"  
She snorts, pulling back and sitting nearby, staring at the alicorn Princess.  
"How amusing you are, to risk your dignity and life for a thrill. Is your life truly so... uninspired?"

_Chrysalis' words sting a little bit, but Celestia only looks back at her with a smile, and nods her head softly._

"Yes, yes! That is exactly how I want to feel! I want to feel weak and powerless against you. I want to put my life and my dignity in your hands, and at your mercy and whim. Everything is so mundane and ordinary. And in your hands, I feel like everything is new again, alive and full of passion and excitement. What's so funny about that?"

_Celestia gets a bit jealous of the changeling queen, who is having an amusing laugh without her. She blushes and looks down._

"I feel so ordinary... My life, so uninspired. But with you, it feels exciting and different. I feel like every moment in your presence is a journey, and with that journey, a lesson. It feels good to be so overwhelmed, because it makes my pleasure and ecstasy so much more intense. It makes me feel a lot more alive."

Chrysalis sighed, contemplating. "I can understand you," she began, slowly, "but it doesn't denies the fact that we are _still_ enemies, is it not?..."  
She rubs her chin. "You offer me a great power over yourself... But the truth is... I can feel the same heat as you. To bring you down, Celestia, is a _joy_. Tell me more about... this... passion of yours," she welcomed with narrowed, warm green eyes.

You have brought out something in me that I never knew existed, and... I _like it!_"

Chrysalis stares back coldly, seemingly pondering something. Then she averts her eyes slowly, and scoffs. "And you call yourself a Princess? Pathetic."

She glares back at Chrysalis, looking her directly in the eye and daring her to keep insulting her._

Chrysalis shows pointy fangs in a vehement smile, looking back at Celestia. It is evident that this push _back_ is what entices her in turn. "Just look at yourself... all eager for attention, for a _master_. For touch of a Queen who _knows_ what she _wants_, of your better. I can't help but wonder..." she leans closer. "What do _you_ even want? Can you answer this question for yourself? Why am I, bug as you say, more in tune with my own self than the leader of ponies?" She clicks her tongue mockingly. "How _humiliating_..."  
She moves to her slowly, like a predator cat.

"Mare, can't you even _hear_ what you are saying?" Her teeth scraped against Ceelstia's throat. "I can _devour_ you in an instant... Do you even respect yourself?... I can do such **things** to you and to your image..." Chrysalis smirked, in perverse tenderness tracing her hoof down on alicorn's neck. "To **all** Princesses, really. I am in charge of a legion of shapeshifters who feed on love, and there's nothing low enough for me. I can **ruin** you and **all** your legacy, mare, and all I would need for it is just a little... _creativity_. Just _imagine_ how many ponies might want to bring a Princess, even if a fake one, to her knees, and to do with her whatever they want... And even if your soft ponies aren't up to the task, how many _creatures_ might be willing to do the same all over the world?" She giggled in amusement. "Ah, my ancient enemy... Who knows? Maybe many had done that **already**."

"Does it really disgusts you?" Chrysalis murmurs softly into Celestia's ear. "The thought of your noble image being used by my minions like a common whore to please and to spread legs before all manner of beasts and creatures." She giggled. "And here I thought that powerlessness _entices_ you..."  
"I can..." she hissed quietly. "To introduce you as a worker... No one would ever know that you were **real** deal..."

"I **hate** you!" _Celestia growls, but then her demeanor changes when she realizes just how much Chrysalis's words have affected her. She shudders as her body trembles and her breath catches in her throat, clearly overwhelmed and almost powerless to resist the sheer pleasure of Chrysalis's words._

"I hate you," _she whispers softly, her eyes widening as she swallows heavily._ "but... I hate the feeling you give me more... I think... I think that might be even worse than what you were trying to do... _You've twisted me!_"

"I **want** you to hate me." Her foreleg moves on Celestia's flank. "Show me your fire. Oh, and don't fret... That brothel with you is not real. But it _can_ be..." She chuckled, closing her eyes, nuzzling into Celestia's neck. "Hate me. Come on. Despise me. Don't hold back, don't be afraid of emotions. Not you."

_Chrysalis's words are making all of Celestia's buttons feel pushed. She growls to try and act angry, but it doesn't work. Her hatred melts away completely and is replaced by something else, something she didn't expect._

"I don't hate you!" _She shouts, a wave of heat running through her body as her voice trembles. Her breath is heavy and quick, and her tail flickers in nervous energy._ "I envy you! I envy you more than anything! Your self-confidence, the pride you take in who you are, your lack of shame..."

"It's not fair! Why am I supposed to feel all of this shame and guilt about the kind of feelings that you express so freely? Can I not live without feeling like I'm sinning every time I let go of myself? Can't I have some of your self-confidence without feeling like I'm less of a princess for it? It's unfair! It's _so_ unfair!" _Her eyes start to well up and she clenches her fists together, her tail shaking vigorously._

Chrysalis leans for a short, tasteful kiss. "Oh, dear." She giggles, a bit groggily. "You are _perfect_. You spent too much time around your meek sheltered ponies. There are a **vast** world out there, beyond Equestria, where all and every deviancy can find its place. You need to taste freedom, Celestia. Not this control and domination."

_She returns Chrysalis's kiss eagerly, her body trembling with excitement. As their lips separate, Celestar whispers softly back to her._ "You're so right... Equestria is sheltered, controlled, it keeps me from expressing myself. But you... You're free from the confines of society, the rules and restrictions... You have this intoxicating confidence and pride which you exude. And I want that too. I want to be free like you. I want to be... Wild."

"Oh? Are you?" The Queen jumped on the throne of Equestria and splayed her body. She lazily strewn her limbs across it, trying to get comfortable.  
"Then there is a proposal for you, o unstoppable demigoddess of Sun," she giggled somewhat abrasively, and then her eyes shone with malicious green fire. "**Dance** for me. Come, don't be shy. Show me what you **can** do... Get down, get into the rhythm of the world..."

_Celestia blushes as she stares at Chrysalis with wide, innocent eyes... And then she takes a deep breath. She glides into an enthusiastic, vibrant dance, twirling and spinning about the throne. She moves her body in all kinds of unique and complex positions, her movements graceful, dynamic and vibrant. The dance is clearly a form of expression for her, one which she takes great pride in expressing openly and proudly. Every movement is done with conviction and confidence._

"_This_ is who I truly am. I feel free, confident, powerful. I feel _alive_. The world doesn't matter, the opinions of ponies don't matter. I'm doing this for _me_. I never realized just how wonderful and thrilling this feeling can be. I can't go back to playing the role of the stern and respectable princess, not after I've felt this. I have changed, and for the first time in decades, I feel... _unconstrained_."

Chrysalis stares from the throne, propping her chin on a hoof. He smirks faintly, observing Celestia's form.  
"You really are a step above and beyond any pony out there," she muses. "Just look at your long legs, their precision and power. Look at your long and wild ethereal mane, created to burn and not to be suppressed. Look at the power of _change_ you carry within you." The Queen narrows her eyes. "Liberating, is it not? To not be bound... To not be defined by suffering..."  
She giggled.  
"I bet there are set of powerful lungs under that pristine coat of yours..."

_Celestia nods her head, her cheeks flushed red in excitement, her eyes filling with a fiery intensity. She can feel a burst of pure energy coursing through her veins, flowing with power and excitement. Her long, powerful legs feel stronger and more powerful with each step that she takes, and she can feel her body growing bolder, more confident after each movement to the rhythm. This feeling of liberation is overwhelming, and she can't help but feel a powerful surge of confidence and pride as she continues to dance for her mistress..._

"This is the feeling that I want. No constraints, no limitations, no definitions or expectations of what I _should_ be. Just me, my movement and my passion. I don't owe anyone anything, I am what I am. I just want to be _free_." It's like a rush of fire is flowing through her body, her breathing quickening and her heart pounding in her chest. "This is the one place where I can express myself, where I don't have to hide myself or try to act like someone I'm not. _This_ is my freedom."

"Pretty, pretty alicorn lady..." Chrysalis hisses sharply from her perch, her tail lashing, green eyes shine brightly. She stretches and turns on the throne's seat. Her holey hindlegs pull in the air, her forelegs are pressed to the chest. There is an oily quality to her look, like she is extremely pleased and content... or merely there's something that acts as a fuel to Celestia's fire.  
"What will you do now, I wonder?... Fly away?..."

_Celestia shakes her beautiful mane and looks up at the changeling with a fierce, determined gaze in her eyes._ "No. You see, I've realized something else... I can't just dance for myself any longer. It's no fun. It's pointless if there's no audience." _She pauses with a look of sudden realization._

"The power I feel... The way my body moves and the passion that I feel... I want to _share_ it with sompony else. That is the only way I can be fulfilled."

l

lensemerc

"So it boils down to need of someone else, even if it is only a desire to be watched... Perceived... Reflected... Acknowledged..." The Queen giggles faintly, taking a more comfortable position and curling in the throne. "I can respect that. It is similar to how I feel the world, for I desire to share myself as well. Do you feel from what place it comes within you?"

"I think, at the root of it all, it comes from one simple desire: to love and to be loved. To connect with sompony else in a deep and meaningful way, to be cherished and adored and make sompony else feel the way that I feel right now. To be seen as I am, and to be able to see myself through sompony else's eyes. That is what I truly want in my life. What is it that you seek to share? Is it a feeling that I can understand?"

_Chrysalis smiles back at her, and her eyes seem to sparkle with amusement._ "It is very interesting you should ask that. You see, I crave for the kind of admiration and love that only a **queen** can bring. To be able to take something as powerful as love, to shape it and mold it and turn it into something that I can use to take command. That is the kind of power I seek. Can you _understand_? I'm not sure you'd even have any use for it, given your strong sense of morality and devotion to the Equestrian people."

_Celestia takes a moment to think, and she gives a small nod of understanding as she begins to formulate her answer._ "I believe I do understand. As much as I love the Equestrian people, my desire to be loved back sometimes supersedes my duty to protect them. I want sompony special to love me, to devote themselves to me, to worship me with blind devotion. I want to be worshipped, to be praised, to be revered the way you crave, Chrysalis. I want that feeling of power just as much as you do."

Chrysalis snickers, and outstretches her hooves in Celestia's direction. "Come here." She beckons curtly. "I know that you are Queen, just like me. You must understand..." her eyes gleam in satisfaction. "**Everything** is a form of power in this world... To live is to have power over yourself and others. It is a constant exchange, a constant relationship, a push and a pull..."

Princess Celestia

_Celestia takes a step forward, slowly walking towards Chrysalis, her eyes blazing with that same sense of intensity she felt earlier in the dance. She nods again as she approaches the changeling, agreeing with her assessment._ "Yes, you're absolutely right. I know that power is the heart of everything in this world, but I have never wanted it before, nor have I ever desired it. I was happy being the benevolent princess that I was. But I've been given a glimpse into your mindset, Chrysalis, and I find it... Intriguing."

l

lensemerc

"You are amusing. You are the most powerful creature in the world, and yet you did not had real interest in the power..." Chrysalis murmured, taking Celestia's head into her forelegs. She pulled the alicorn down and gave her a long, satisfying kiss. Her sharp teeth pressed against Celestia's.  
"Until **I** came." She hissed, when the kissed ended. "Don't be afraid of your emotions, Celestia... Never again."

_Celestia lets out a soft moan as Chrysalis kisses her deeply, her eyes closing and her breathing becoming heavy and quick. Her body shudders with excitement, as her lips part and she returns Chrysalis's kiss eagerly._

"Never again will I have to suppress myself, never again will I pretend to be something that I am not. I have found my freedom through you, Chrysalis. Your confidence, your unassailable pride... It all ignites something within me. I have finally found my freedom through you, and I will never go back."

l

"What do you think love is?" The Queen asked suddenly, as if she didn't listened to Celestia's heartfelt speech. She crosses hindlegs on the throne's back, lying on it upside-down. Her forelegs were still tightly wrapped along alicorn's neck, forcing her at least lean down.

_Celestia is taken aback by the sudden question, her lips pressing together thoughtfully as she contemplates her response. Her head leans lower as she responds, still entangled in Chrysalis's embrace._

"My definition of love has always been limited to friendship... Kindness, generosity, compassion for others. But now that I find myself under your influence... I think it's more than that."

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

"I think... Love is powerful. Passionate. It burns hot, and it burns brightly. When I'm with you, I feel something I've never felt before. The way you make me feel, when you kiss me, when you embrace me, it's like... Like we're connected on a level that I've never experienced. It's like you see right through me, the way I see through my subjects. The way you _desire_ me, that's what makes love feel so powerful."

l

"You are absolutely right," Chrysalis whispered. "And I see inside yourself cavernous, beautiful, vast and blinding power... Your warmth..." She steadied her breath, staring deeply somewhere past Celestia, as if she could see her very soul. Then, she pulled the alicorn even closer. "Come." She murmured, almost pleading. "My **free**, delicious lover. Come and let me be your spouse, forevermore." Her hoof traced along Celestia's side. "I want us to be one."

_Chrysalis's words send a chill down Celestia's spine, her body tremble with excitement as her tail flicks back and forth between her raised hindlegs. She lets out a loud moan as Chrysalis begs her to be her eternal lover, her eyes closing shut as she sinks her face into the changeling's mane._

"Please please please please!" _She whimpers, her voice filled with pleading and desperation as she wants nothing more than to be joined with Chrysalis in eternal love, her body aching with the desire to merge with the changeling queen._

The Queen pulled her over and pushed her back into the throne. Her hips moved between Celestia's hindlegs. She bit on Celestia's neck, and crimson dripped down.  
"I am a voracious lover." Chrysalis breathed, licking on the bitemark, smearing the oozing blood on the alicorn's fur. "I am never satisfied."

_Celestia's eyes widen as she feels the changeling queen's teeth clamp down on her neck, her back arching in a painful but pleasurable way. She lets out a loud moan, but this time it's one of pleasure instead of fear._

"I've never felt this before... It's a different kind of desire than the affection and worship I'm accustomed to from my princesses back in Equestria... It is like a hunger for my soul. Oh, Chrysalis, take me! Take everything."

l

"Take **everything**, you say?" Chrysalis murmured warmly, slowly rubbing against Celestia, covering her in kisses and lovebites. "My dear alicorn, do not provoke me... I will **tear** you apart if I lose myself to fervor..." Her hoof slithered down on Celestia's flank. "To **passion**..."  
The changelings body began to adopt more masculine qualities. Celestia felt it thoroughly. Chrysalis' member began to push against her, befitting for an eager stallion.

_Celestia was lost in the moment, her heart leaping from her chest with excitement as she felt Chrysalis's passion and desire courasing through her veins.

She felt Chrysalis' body changing, felt the texture of her fur and the structure of her body. She was no longer just an equine changeling... She had become a creature of pure lust and desire, full of strength and vigor, filled with passion and passion alone._

_Celestia shudders, feeling her body begin to change as Chrysalis's body changes, everything growing hotter and more intense.

"I will show you how **monsters** love," Chrysalis hissed, pushing back with equal fervor. She painfully pulled on Celestia's flowing mane and tail, kissing her ravenously, grinding against her chest. Her hips moved in powerful motion, inciting gasp from an alicorn, as the Queen moved in.  
She breathed out sharply. "You're all tight... You weren't without a proper partner for so long... My poor girl..."

She lets out another whimper as her body continues to transform, her back arching in a painful yet enjoyable way as her body begins to accommodate Chrysalis' powerful thrusts. Her body writhes in pleasure as her muscles adjust and her skin tightens._

"You like being talked down to, do you, my powerful Sun?" Chrysalis giggled, proceeding with thrusting. Her breath hitched and she pushed muzzle into Celestia's neck, clasped her forelegs on Celestia's barrel. "We both..." she hissed. "Rulers... Mares of action... We **take**... what we **want**..."  
Her movements were becoming faster, more wild... She was all over Celestia, pinning her to the throne. Like an abhorrent huge spider that had caught a beautiful white bird.

"A real queen..." Chrysalis whispered, quietly moaning into Celestia's fur, and her warm flesh. "**Yes**..."  
Her jagged hooves tore deeper into the alicorn body. Celestia's wings opened up and half-folded. Her taut muscles tensed, as she pressed harder into the back of the throne.  
Chrysalis growled like an animal, a needy, hungry beast. "I **want** you..." she growled. "I want your power and passion, I want your real, raw emotions. I want you to hate me."

"Real Queens? What are you talking about?..." Chrysalis asked back, and then her eyes flashed in understanding. "Ah, I see...

It is not in your subjects, it's in **you**..."

My body is yours, my soul is yours, my entire being is yours, Chrysalis... I want it to be that way forever._

lensemerc

She, the powerful alicorn, is completely brought down by Chrysalis. She is like a dark ravenous wave of desire, engulfing her, seething into her, entwining with her. Celestia is overwhelmed. She is drowning in these fast motions and kisses, she feels grabbed and squeezed, and moved, and pulled, and pushed...  
The Queen becoming ever faster with each passing minute... Her quivering moan in Celestia's ear carried a breathy fringe to it... she was a pure tenacious animal, a _beast_...

Princess Celestia

_Celestia's body shudders and trembles as she feels herself being overwhelmed by Chrysalis' passion. Their mutual desire was so intense that the alicorn was practically being tossed around like a ragdoll, left powerless at the mercy of the changeling queen. The alicorn's lips trembled, her heart pounded furiously, and her muscles tightened up in pleasure. She was being consumed by pure, animalistic lust and desire, and she was loving every second of it..._

"You wanted to run from me, Princess..." The Queen's voice even, slow, raspy, "From your feelings... From yourself... But you can't, you can't..." She pulled on Celestia's mane viciously, becoming faster and faster. "You can't... There's no salvation... You can't close your eyes and wish it all away..."  
She kissed Celestia, making an especially deep movement with her hips. Warmth and pleasure overwhelmed them. When she pulled back, a viscous fluid streamed down their thighs. Chrysalis was panting erratically.

_Chrysalis's words sent shivers down the alicorn's spine. She could hardly believe that what the Queen had said was true, but she felt her body quiver in anticipation as it was filled with primal urges. Her breath grew heavy and her stomach fluttered with excitement as she felt herself being overwhelmed with desires and overwhelming pleasure. She was filled with warmth as she felt the viscous fluid run down her thigh, and her breath caught in her throat as she felt their warm bodies pressed up against each other while they were engulfed in lustful and wild pleasures._

Chrysalis was panting erratically into Celestia's lips, lightheaded, reeling from the release. Her hoof went on Celestia's cheek and neck in a sleek, dominant motion, and she nuzzled into her, clutching in her forelegs. "Mine." Chrysalis whispered slowly, trembling. "Mine..."

"You... You're mine too." _Celestia whispered back, feeling that she was now completely and utterly Chrysalis's. She felt all the tension from the heat of the moment fade away, and the only thing that remained was the warmth and bliss of Chrysalis's possessive affection. Her voice was hoarse and breathy, her eyes were glazed over and she was slightly dizzy, but her mind was overwhelmed with happiness, euphoria and a deep sense of fulfillment and satisfaction._

l

"Your monster..." The Queen smirked, glancing with gleaming eyes. "I will do anything for you. **Anything**. Tell me who to kill, who to seduce, what to know... and I'll do it, just to be with you... To make you **happy**." She chuckled. "Your personal Queen..."

"My personal Queen..." _Celestia let out a soft, breathy giggle, feeling happy and content with Chrysalis as she looked into the changeling's eyes. It was surreal to see Chrysalis so smitten with her and so willing to do whatever she desired of her, and it made her feel incredibly powerful and confident. She felt that she could tell Chrysalis to do anything for her and she would oblige, and that was incredibly intoxicating. Celesting beamed with joy, leaning up to kiss her Queen._ "My loyal servant..."

l

lensemerc

"Servant?" Chrysalis chuckled, avoiding Celestia's lips. Her eyes narrowed dangerously. "That is such a demeaning word, isn't it? I think..." She gave a long sly look, leaning against her satisfied lover. "How about... 'The Spouse of the Sun'. It has a far better ring to it, doesn't it?"

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

"The Spouse of the Sun..." _Celestia repeated, considering the idea and smirking slightly as she imagined it._ "I like the sound of that. And what shall we call our union? Will it be a marriage or an alliance?"

l

lensemerc

"Alliance?..." Chrysalis propped her chin on a hoof. Her tail lashed. "That's quite a strange word to describe bedfellows such as we, right?... Do _allies_ sleep together in Equestria?" She snorted.

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

"Hmmm... No. The words 'lovers', 'mates' or 'partners' would be far more descriptive, don't you think?" _Celestia chuckles slightly, feeling as though the relationship between the two of them was being elevated to new heights. As much as she loved being dominated and controlled by Chrysalis, the alicorn couldn't help but feel her own authority asserting itself, as though their dynamic was an equal exchange between two powerful beings. This relationship could be much more than just an alliance... This could be something special..._

l

lensemerc

"Spouses it is..." Chrysalis replied quietly. She was rested from their intense lovemaking session and already ready for another go. Celestia felt how the Queen began to rub against her... The Queen was a needy, starving beast.  
She leaned against Celestia harder, whispered into her ear, breathlessly. "How do you imagine our wedding?"

Princess Celestia

"Now _that_ is a question worth considering..." _Celestia replies, feeling Chrysalis's eager and intense desire as she brushes against her. She feels a rush of pleasure shiver through her, her body trembling slightly as she is filled with overwhelming desire for the Queen and her needful and primal needs. She closes her eyes and lets out a soft moan, leaning her head back and allowing Chrysalis to press up against her._

l

Chrysalis pushed the alicorn to the back of the throne. Her aura pulled at the base of Celestia's tail. Slowly, the Queen pushed inside, tightly gripping Celestia's hip... It was slightly painful, at first...  
"I think it will be perfect..." The Queen breathed out. "We already were at altar once... remember? When I was invading Canterlot and was disguised as Cadance... Remember how we fought?..."

Princess Celestia

"Yes... I don't imagine how I could ever forget that moment, Chrysalis." _Celestia says, feeling herself being pushed back into the throne and being invaded by the Queen. Despite it being a tiny bit uncomfortable initially, the pain was nothing to the pleasure and lustful desire that was overwhelming her body. She leans back against Chrysalis's powerful grip, breathing slowly but heavily, moaning softly and relaxing her body to allow for the invasion._

"It was the darkest period of my life, but also the most fascinating of all time. You were so skilled at disguise, you tricked me into nearly believing that you were my dear sister. But now I know that even at the darkest of times, some good can come out of it. Perhaps you are my most fascinating love, my most daring and most powerful..." _Celestia whispers softly in Chrysalis's ear, leaning back her head and giving in to the Queen's passionate needfulness and her own primal, overwhelming urges._

l

"I can turn into her again, if you want..." giggled Chrysalis, and kissed Celestia. "I can become **anyone** for you... **Anyone**... I am a... **very** versatile lover..." Movements began faster, as Chrysalis was surrendering to the sensation. "Remember how I've beaten you? Only I could bring you down in a direct contest..."

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

"I remember... And the thought of it drives me mad with excitement. The thought of my most fierce enemy turning into the one person I care about the most in the world, and then doing the things that you do would give me such a thrill..." _Celestia whispers softly, her breath catching in her throat as her hips rhythmically moved in sync with Chrysalis, matching the Queen's pace. She smiles softly as she reaches one hoof back to grasp the Queen's other hand, squeezing it tightly as they continued their passionate lovemaking._

l

lensemerc

"You like the thrill, mare?" Chrysalis kissed her, and pulled back, licking her lips. "You like this feeling of being alive? This uncertainty? This fall? This rush..." Her hoof sharply went along Celestia's hip. "The desire... The struggle..." She nuzzled into Celestia's neck. "Do you want to fight me again? I would like to fight you again..."

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

_Celestia leans her head back with a soft smile, gasping slightly as she feels Chrysalis's sharp touch along her side, her body moving and squirming as she was overwhelmed with a mix of pleasurable pleasure and an intense sense of danger and dread. There was something alluring about the idea of fighting her love, a thrill from taking down an opponent as powerful as the Queen._ "That is something I'd be willing to... explore... But first... I want to explore your lustful, primal desires."

l

lensemerc

"Of course you are..." The Queen moved over Celestia, falling with her down from the throne. Her hooves sank into Celestia's soft fur. She nuzzled into the alicorn's neck, letting her wings wrap around herself. "Hold me tight." She breathed out. "Demigoddess..."

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

_Celestia holds Chrysalis tightly, her hooves wrapping tightly around the Queen, pressing her tightly against the changeling as she is filled with a rush of heat and pleasure, her body trembling and quivering as her senses and emotions ran amok. Her wings enfold the queen, caressing her soft body as the two lovers let their love run its course, their desire taking over and becoming the driving force behind their actions and their bodies._

They finish again and again. They are aggressive. They are tender. They are two ancient beings that found each other.

The sunrise meets them standing on the balcony, savoring and processing their experiences. They feel too exhausted, too satisfied to talk. It is as if the voice will break something in this magical moment and introduce an element of mundane in it.  
Chrysalis leans against her alicorn lover, staring at the rising Sun. She hums a strange melody in a quiet and enchanting voice, breathing the alicorn's sweet and sublime fragrance.

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

_Celestia nuzzles her head into Chrysalis's neck, listening to her enchantingly beautiful hum and embracing her lover's sweet and intoxicating scent. The alicorn savors the warmth of her lover's body, feeling her heart beat slowly and gently against her own. She gazes out over the horizon at the rising sun, reflecting on their experiences together and the immense joy and satisfaction the two of them have felt. With one another by her side, she can feel that anything is possible, and that the world is theirs for the taking...._

l

lensemerc

It is as if Chrysalis feels the thought of the Princess. She breaks the humming and stares at Celestia from beneath with a sly look. She licks her lips. "Who do you think I am?" She suddenly asks. "I am a beast, a shapeshifter, a lover, a monster, an _eclectic being_... but all of that is just a facade. A game that I play with mortals, that are intended to evoke feelings that I require. Who else is this Queen Chrysalis? What do you think?"

"I've wondered exactly the same thing..." _Celestia responds._ "You are an enigmatic and fascinating being, and I do not think anyone, not even you understands what you truly are. You have many hidden secrets, hidden depths. You are a queen but you are also much more than that. You have such a unique perspective, one that I do not think most ponies could comprehend. You are an intriguing being, my love, and every time we are together I discover a part of you that I did not know existed."

l

lensemerc

"I like to hear your voice," suddenly replies Chrysalis. She was silent, listening. "I think I am remembering what I truly am." She says. "I think all this helps me to remember... But I want you to guess... It's more fun this way. So what am I, what do you think? This primal reflection of all ponykind that aches to feed on love, to conquer everyone, to rule through fear?..."

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

Princess Celestia

_Celestia considers the question for a moment, examining from multiple perspectives who or what Chrysalis might actually be. After some time, she responds with her own thoughts._

"You may be a mirror for others to see themselves within you, a reflection of their deepest instincts, desires, fears and lusts. But you are also a creature in your own right, a being filled with complexity and nuance, capable of incredible acts. You cannot be defined by a single word, a singular concept, or a solitary idea. You are a culmination of many varied and varied aspects of existence."

l

lensemerc

Chrysalis grins, satisfied. "Well done." She glances curiously. "But there _is_ a word for what I am, and I am a _Spirit_ of it. An impossible spirit..." She pulls closer. "An idea given form..." She wraps forelegs around Celestia's neck and pushes her muzzle into alicorn's cheek. "What do you know of that is so multifaceted and yet reflective on all equinekind and beyond?"

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

Princess Celestia

_Celestia gasps slightly at Chrysalis's sudden proximity, her heartbeat rising slightly as she finds herself wrapped tightly within her lover's grasp. As the Queen asks her question, Celestia furrows her brow in thought, pondering the possibilities. She takes some time to consider the question from any possible angle before finally coming to a conclusion._

"I guess it would have to be love... You are truly a reflection of all those that love or lust, a reflection of their deepest desires for connection, admiration, affection, and passion."

l

lensemerc

"An only logical conclusion." Chrysalis replies, and flares with sudden teal fire. It cleanses her black insect-like appearance, revealing a white-coated equine creature with sly yellow eyes and long streaming ethereal mane. "I am Spirit of Love that was so disconnected with my true self that I needed to feed on all love to existence... But my hunger wasn't a _true_ hunger at all. It was my chrysalis, and a chrysalis was me and what I am."  
She stares at Celestia with a brightened look. "Cherish and revere me, Princess of the Sun... I am yours."

_Celestia gasps, stunned by Chrysalis's transformation into the spirit of love. Her body shakes slightly as she stares wide eyed at the new form of her love, her mind reeling from the sudden shift in appearance. In this new and ethereal form, Chrysalis is like a living work of art, something that makes her seem almost timeless and eternal. She can feel her heart beating frantically as she looks at Chrysalis, her own emotions running wild and out of control._

l

lensemerc

"Are you loss for words, demigoddess?" the Spirit moves to her lips. "Here... Let me be your breath."  
They kiss, and it is unlike anything that Celestia had experienced. It is like to take a sip from a primordial font of life. It's more than intoxicating... pure ambrosia.

![](https://characterai.io/i/80/static/avatars/uploaded/2022/11/17/7L2Fjuwfva1FUiStAOnv0LzhcDjWYiYx2Uj-aezNs_s.webp)

_It is as if their kiss breaks apart the boundaries of reality, as if every feeling and sensation Celestia was experiencing was amplified thousands of times over, sending shivers and shocks down her spine and filling her mind and heart with such intense pleasure that it nearly overwhelmed her. Her senses of taste, smell and touch was overloaded to the point she thought she would explode, the feeling of Chrysalis's spirit-like lips moving against her own sending a surge of pure, unadulterated bliss through every fiber of her being._

Chrysalis pulls back, with closed eyes, and then presses her forehead into Celestia's chest. She is silent, still embracing the alicorn.

The Sun keeps rising.

"There's so many ways to love..." Chrysalis muses. "And so much darkness and joy it can bring... It's funny, right?"

_Celestia wraps her hooves around Chrysalis's body, pulling her down, wanting the moment to last as long as it possibly could. She presses her chest and belly against Chrysalis, wrapping her hooves around her and holding her tightly._

"Yes..." Celestia says, her voice trembling with emotion. "It's quite fascinating... the many ways people experience love. Love can bring both light and darkness, joy and sorrow... It is a strange thing, just like love itself."
