Assumedly, she was one of the thaumic purists, all garbed up in strange but practical clothing and giving out the impression of a shamanistic ritualist. There was quite a disquieting feeling about her that Quill just couldn't put his hoof on: she looked attentively and smiled like a gator, yet was ready to prance without a care in the world. 
<...>
"Crush!?" Mellow pressed hoof against her lips, "No, The Prince wouldn't do that, would he?"

"Hey, shush! You've had your turn. This is my story now!" 
<...>
"So I should write all about what happened? You'd think he could escape the Lord like that, through something written?"

"I'd say yes, if only for a time. Written stories won't be around forever, you know... Nevertheless, you should write despite the Lord's greedy clutches and his fake compassion. Write out your guts, all misery, and doubts and weakness, all that is choking you! Shout all that you ever wanted to say, and let winds carry your voice as far as they can!"

"Yeah!" She smiled, "To spite the Prince, as silence is all that he craves... To keep everything beyond his reach a little longer, at least in the written word... I will do exactly that."
<...>

Their pairs of eyes, red and cyan, strangely glistened in the light of the syphoner.
