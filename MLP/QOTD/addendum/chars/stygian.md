god damn that's a rad design SURE HOPE STYGIAN STAYS AROUND AND MASTERS HIS POWERS FOR THE POWER OF GOOD AND ISN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT AS SAY A PRODIGY FOR LUNA TO TUTOR

Not willing to give up, Twilight attempts to forcibly separate Stygian from the Pony of Shadows in order to save them. Together with Starlight, they try to drag Stygian out by his hooves but require more magic energy to do so. Starswirl, finally seeing his error and now wanting to save Stygian instead of banish him, has everypony redirect their magical energy to forcing Stygian and the Pony of Shadows apart instead of pushing them both through the portal. They succeed and the shadowy energy creature gets sucked into the portal without Stygian.

The team climb out of the large hole leading to the Well of Shade and are surprised to find that they still have the Elements of Harmony, with Fluttershy suggesting that their use of the elements to save Stygian instead of doom him was the reason they didn't disappear.

Starswirl pulls Stygian out of the hole, reconciles with him and expresses his regret for believing Stygian betrayed him and the Pillars. He also gives an apology to Twilight for not seeing the magic potential of friendship, which goes a long way toward repairing the damage Starswirl did by treating Twilight so brusquely and angrily putting her down over the course of the adventure.

Starswirl also is called out for dismissing and disrespecting Starlight's suggestions that there was a solution other than banishment and the map only ever calls for solving friendship problems. Starswirl admits he owes many apologies and has the good grace to look abashed for dismissing Twilight and Starlight, insisting only on his "my way or the highway" approach.
