1. ### 1:40_]_Tipper_:_ 
    
    I always liked the rare version of Blueblood who is a jerk, but for whom it’s a sort of positive trait.
    
2. ### _[_1:41_]_Tipper_:_ 
    
    He is absolutely a bastard. But he’s a justified one and in a world of very nice ponies, sometimes a bastard comes in handy.
    
3. ### _[_1:42_]_Tipper_:_ 
    
    Makes him useful in diplomatic terms to show ponies aren’t always nice. And when he’s being a dick, _usually_ it’s to somepony who deserves it.
