    Writing a trixie esque character and I _think_ I get it now! She's fun either way, sociopathic egotism ftw.

    _I_ can do anything, I can _beat_ you at _anything_ because I understand stagecraft and illusion and how to get a crowd cheering for me. In my view, that is the centre of the Trixian philosophy. The rest is just... creatively re-telling past exploits in a way that minimises the contribution of anyone else and maximises the contribution of Trixie.

    In this case it's more "Ego the size of jupiter, incredible theatricality and a bit of spite"
    
2. ### _[_13:33_]_CCC_:_ 
    
    Ego the size of Jupiter is important, yes.

    But where the stagecraft comes in - let's say that Trixie does her "anything you can do I can do better" presentation and Shining Armour steps up, claiming he can beat her at shielding. What does Trixie do?
    
4. ### _[_13:35_]_CCC_:_ 
    
    In my mind, she hands him three water balloons, and takes three herself. Whoever is better at shielding won't be hit by the other one's balloons, right?
    
5. ### _[_13:36_]_CCC_:_ 
    
    She uses distractions and illusions - before long, there's _three_ Trixies wandering about, at least two of which are clearly illusions (actually all three are illusions, the real Trixie is nowhere near them, hiding nearby).
    
6. ### _[_13:38_]_CCC_:_ 
    
    She also covers Shining Armour's shield in darkness (so he can't see out), places all three of her water balloons around his shield, and then creates an illusion of (either Twilight or Cadance) briefly _screaming_. Being a heroic type. Shining drops the shield he can't see out of and charges to the rescue - directly into Trixie's water balloons. (She's a unicorn, she can hold them at a distance).
    
7. ### _[_13:39_]_CCC_:_ 
    
    Then she claims victory.
