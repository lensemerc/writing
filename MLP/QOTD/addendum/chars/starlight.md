Starlight is always making excuses to keep from having to learn more friendship lessons, and has outright denied growing like when she didn't want to leave Twilight too early after the changeling's second invasion.

if no one has magic, they have nothing to feel better than each other over, (цитата чела из дискорда)

    Both of them afraid of regressing.

    Both of them afraid of growing and changing.

Sometimes I hear people saying: "Starlight never got punished for her actions" but I think her thoughts about herself are her personal punishment, and this song represents that perfectly

Glim before reformation was cool anyway ![😒](https://discord.com/assets/19581aca5d78feac3a180971f24d399b.svg) Not because of timeline destruction, but because she seemed like a genuinely plotting individual who used manipulation tactics to break ponies into submission

    Up until Estees glimmer, it felt like there was a real lack of Starlight stories that really got to why she was my favorite villain in the series

    Sort of adult Cozy Glow
    
1. ### _[_15:10_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    Exactly. She was the best villain up until her secound appreance
    
2. ### _[_15:11_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Yeah. Guess 'reformation' hit her so hard, that she overexerted in her effort to seem better than she is (изменено)

    Good venue to explore with the character

    She doesn't seem to me like a regular unicorn at all.

    But yes, this was someone new. A nemesis all Twilight's own. A _philosophical_ threat to Equestria rather than an obvious physical one.
    
3. ### _[_15:16_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    Or as I imagined it, a purely cynical pony looking for power.

    I do so wish the writers of the premiere and finale had actually coordinated to some meaningful degree.

    She wanted to rule her little kingdom. She never cared about cutie marks. She just wanted to rule. That's how I always saw her

    It's the 1% I'm disappointed with in Glimmer
    
9. ### _[_15:17_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    That no fic has made her both a terrifying villian and purely in it for power
