Every time I close my eyes, I see nightmares.

Love and war so close to one another...

афродита / венус см.

Achilles points out that Aphrodite is a terrifyingly competent warrior, with the ability to fell nations and stir armies to action by playing on their emotions to manipulate them, to the point that Achilles is both afraid of, and admires how truly dangerous Aphrodite is, which is a side of her that's often ignored that I was super stoked to see referenced in the game.

The first thing any diplomat learns is to protect their weak spots

"I am a diplomat, and war is merely a method of diplomacy. Maybe the least effective one, but still..." 

I picture her as a very shrewd pony who was genuinely expected to be successor to Celestia and was trained as such. In all out war she could be vicious

No matter how many ponies die in a war, it's always too many.

In a peaceful time though, her nice and kind personality is more prevalent, but she's still a very cunning pony and when she does want something she'll be tenacious about it (but still polite).

"I think you mistake politeness with weakness."

    She's probably the sort to stop an army by getting the general's wife into her city. Where said general's wife will absolutely not be mistreated. No, she will be given a very good meal, where she can simply ask for almost anything and get it at once, in comfortable surroundings... ...which just _happen_ to be _very close_ to the wall that the invaders are approaching. "Almost anything" does not include an _exit_. And then Cadance will set up a video call with the general in question. She won't threaten. She won't bluster. She'll even promise to send the general's wife home, quite safely, by that evening. But I think it's _very_ likely that the army is going to stop advancing at that point.

    Cadence's headspace is fascinating. Kind, supportive, open-minded... and just slightly alien.

    yeah, she is supposed to be like your cool older sis, almost down-to-earth and without any hidden agenda
    
2. ### _[_15:44_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    maybe something similar to Twilight, but more mature and less booksmart

    And _maybe_ an ulterior motive in matchmaking.
    
4. ### _[_15:46_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    well, yes. I won't be playing into that, but definitely. like noticing who is good for whom, and nudging into right direction, lightheartedly
    
5. ### _[_15:46_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    which implies observant nature, of course, yes
I think it's an interesting direction to take Cadance's character. It's understandable how her experiences with the changelings, and all the violence and betrayal would cause her to become jaded and cynical. The struggle between her desire to protect and do what is right, and her growing anger and resentment towards the world, could make for a compelling story arc.
