## Conjecture #4: Cozy Glow is not actually a pony

I have no idea _what_ she is, but by now I’m convinced she’s not from Equestria in the first place. I listed several arguments for this in the actual PoC post for [**School Raze**](https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/827357/points-of-canon-s8x25-26-school-raze), however, let’s do this more concisely:

- In public and with Neighsay, she always says “we ponies” but once one on one with a victim, it’s suddenly “you ponies.”
- She drains magic to “another realm,” by her own admission.
- As pegasus education stands now in Equestria, it definitely does not include knowledge of ritual magic. It doesn’t even include knowledge that it is _possible,_ as Celestia’s description of the curriculum demonstrates in [**School Daze**](https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/802539/points-of-canon-s8x01-02-school-daze). The idea that a pegasus might be capable of doing it is quite alien to pony practice, it’s not something you stumble upon easily.
- Cozy Glow behaves markedly differently between [**Marks for Effort**](https://www.fimfiction.net/blog/813756/points-of-canon-s8x12-marks-for-effort) and **School Raze**, and yet uses the same vocabulary, far in advance of what a child her apparent age would use.
- Celestia and Luna incarcerate Cozy Glow without a second thought in a cage among monsters. Either they did this to a little filly when every adult _pony_ who did anything of the sort**(4)** was forgiven on the spot, or they are aware that Cozy Glow is not what she appears to be.
- No parental figures or guardians appear to contest the above sentencing or even simply to worry.

We’ve seen manipulative adult ponies before – for example, Suri Polomare and Svengallop. They don’t behave _quite_ like this, do they?

## Conjecture #5: Cozy Glow’s plan

The shakiest part of the whole thing, but I think it makes sense, if only because I’m not the only one to have come up with it. [Reese](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/29087/Reese) offered a quote that I think fits here very well:

> Gold? It flowed as though there were an endless supply. The commander shipped enough back on the first load to make them all wealthy.
> 
> The commander didn’t go back home to spend his wealth amid the luxuries of the Imperial court, even though Emperor Carl appointed him to the nobility. That sort of thing wasn’t the commander’s meat. There, he would be a fourth-rate noble; here, he was the Imperial Viceroy, responsible only to the distant Emperor. There, he would be nothing; here, he was almost a king.

My theory is that Cozy Glow is an _unwilling participant_ in a scheme to steal as much magic from Equestria as possible. Unwilling, but nowhere _friendly_ enough to trust ponies to help her. Her actual masters are not interested in her fate, and are only concerned about magic, which isn’t something Cozy Glow herself desires to have. She resents them and does not want to go back.

Plan A is to exploit the situation to become a pony of status and influence, by supplanting Twilight Sparkle. An opportunity to get Twilight out of the way presents itself as part of her primary job that she can’t avoid doing – so she sends Twilight on a wild goose chase. But it fails.

Plan B, however, is… To end up in Tartarus! [Damaged](https://www.fimfiction.net/user/216165/Damaged) proposed that Cozy Glow could have had this as a desirable failure state in her plan, and I think I know _how_ could it be desirable: Being in communication with Tirek, Cozy Glow is aware of the nature of Tartarus, _as well_ as aware that it has a leak. She knows that this prison has acquired a revolving door – but at the same time, it does keep one alive and youthful beyond what would normally be possible, and while she will age, it will happen at a greatly reduced rate.

Eventually, Tartarus will break open, one way or another, and she will emerge with an army of monsters – but by that time, her masters will be dead or weakened, whatever hold they have over her will be released and she will be free. And as we have seen, Cozy Glow is good at the long game.

The above makes a better story than taking this episode at face value, I’m sure.
