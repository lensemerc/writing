“Comedy,” Luna began in a solid contralto, “is an improvement on tragedy. They should rarely mix. Plays that do so are…” she trailed off “…are reductive.”

“Of course,” Luna shrugged a wing. She stumbled over a rock and braced it against the wall. “One must pass the time.” Her head lolled and her horn waved lazily. The ceiling began to weep with strands of liquid silver.


“You are dreaming.” Luna’s voice sounded strange.


“This is a recur…” Luna stopped, “recur-rant dream?” A hoof kicked a stone and it plinked off the wall. “You have it often?”


Luna blinked glassy cyan eyes a few times to focus.

“Indeed,” Luna said flatly.

“The world does not revolve around you.” Luna’s head swayed to the side when she rolled her eyes. “I am usually drunk. Stand, or I shall pound you through the floor. It will still hurt.”

“He did not see their dreams in the night of the battles to come, of their fallen friends, of their homes. Of his voice ringing in their ears heralding new nightmares and the whistle of falling shells.”

"It takes a strong mare to face your choices," Luna nickered. "Tell me: Did my sister even leave the dock?"

Flurry paused. “She was waiting for me.”

“Oh filly,” Luna sighed. “The only thing that could stop my sister was my sister. She returned as if she was out at the market, declaring you ‘too far gone’ to aid. And that was all. I watched her begin to reread a book worn down to the binding this morning after throwing out all the papers…”

She hung her head. “You are not the only one who is lost. When I realized she was gone, I had hoped…” her voice echoed. Luna slowly shut her jaw and pinched her eyes. “Hope is a dangerous thing.”


“A mare attempting to escape a destiny carved into crystal bark?” Luna hiccupped. “What future was at the end of this war, win or lose? A wandering through a land rent asunder by war? Or more devotion to a crown when the fire had already begun to gutter out?”

“Destiny is a choice.”

“What if you come to regret the choice you made?” Luna asked the sky.


Luna struggled to pull her lips into a smile. "I may have failed at everything else, but I am still her shadow." She hiccupped and her glassy eyes misted. Her head lolled to the side. "I used to dread that. There is no point in regret."


“Fie!” Luna brayed with a coughing laugh. “The swears of today are nothing to what they were. As are most things.” She leaned her neck down, and exhaled. Flurry scrunched her nose at the blast of alcohol on the alicorn’s breath. “I shall hit you in the waking world should we ever meet. Did you know that was my sister’s last crown?” She pulled her head back.


Luna looked down at her and clicked her teeth. "Retirement suits us, don't you think?" She waltzed to the side and stumbled over her hooves, but recovered with a splash of moonlight. "I await my mane turning gray, but I do not think stars dim like that. They should."

“That crown was expensive,” Luna continued. “You should have stolen it and used it as collateral for your tithes to the Reich.” She sniffed. “I should find mine. ‘Tis in a box. Somewhere.”

Luna hummed. “Pardon?”

“Ah,” Luna nodded in realization. “Nay, foal. You misunderstand. ‘Twas the plan before the war.” She slapped a few feathers against a support pillar. “Your mind conjures strong mines, young Heart.”

Luna sighed and leaned against the support pillar. She slid downwards slightly and her eyes widened for a moment at the stumble, but the alicorn caught herself. Her hooves skittered on the ground. “My sister wished to retire,” she explained in a slow voice. “Before you were even born.”


“Yes,” Luna said with forced amusement. “There was an amulet. Shame it was shelved. Would have been nice to-”

Luna clacked her jaw shut and watched the magical voice sunder the walls of the mine with casual disinterest. Her eyes widened slightly as her leaning post wiggled to the side and made her hooves stumble again. She shoved the support beam back into position with a grunt.

“Nay,” Luna denied. “We wished to move on.”

“Move on from what?” Flurry whinnied. “Your fucking wings? Your horn? You wanted-” she stopped. _Stalliongrad, Nightmare, Sombra, Tirek, Choices, Tests, Destiny…_

“It wasn’t supposed to go this way,” Luna sighed. “Have you ever imagined yourself without it?”

“Without what?” Flurry snarled. “My horn?” She stuck out her wings. “Th-these wings are most of m-my body!”

“That.” Luna braced herself to point a forehoof. She swayed and clomped it back down.

Flurry reached up with a wing to touch under her mane. Her feathers brushed against metal. She scrunched her muzzle and wrapped a few feathers around the band to pull it off, lowering her horn.

The alicorn held her golden, dented, cheap crown in her forelegs. Her eyes searched the metal before she sniffled and snorted. She moved to chuck it deeper into the leaking mine but the throw collapsed into a pout. “It’s gone.”

“Not here,” Luna answered. Her eyes lingered on Flurry’s forelegs. The younger alicorn traced her stare to the swirling scar above her left hoof. She looked to Luna’s legs.

They trembled with exertion from standing, but they were bare. The alicorn looked beautiful and could have carried herself with grace. Luna’s teeth were blazing white when she grimaced. “Have you ever imagined yourself without it?” Her sparkling mane drifted around her horn.

The Princess of the Moon had nothing but her fur.

“Once,” Flurry admitted in a cold voice. “It was a lie.”

“It did not need to be.”

“But it was.” Flurry shoved the crown back on her head. “You didn’t deserve it. You never deserved it.”

Luna hummed. “Seemed like a good idea at the time.” A wing brushed back against her cutie mark of a full moon in the night. “We raised the sun and moon.”

“You don’t need a crown to do that.”

The mare’s smile in return was only on half her muzzle like her muscles failed her. “We did not. But it sounds nice, does it not? Makes our jobs seem grand: The Princesses of the Sun and Moon.”

“What makes a Princess?” Luna warbled.

“Horn and wings,” Flurry answered bluntly.

“You seem to meet the standard,” Luna chortled.

“We don’t get to walk away.”

“Not after a millennium?” Luna stumbled. “What then? Who are you, young Heart?””

"I am the Princess of Ponies."

"So was I," Luna mused. Her steps were off-kilter on the silver lake. "So was she. So were we all. One title after another, and one was always last." She whirled back around.

_"The first shall be last and the last shall be first,"_ Luna quoted. She gave a dry chuckle. "Griffons believe such nonsense." She wrung her starry mane with a flourish that turned into a stumbling bow. "Not like we are any better, but I remember when they hung entrails from trees for the old gods."
