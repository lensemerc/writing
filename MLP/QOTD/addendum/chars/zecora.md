    Which now makes me wonder about Zecora's dating prospects... ![:ZippThink:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/899458175282053141.webp?size=44&quality=lossless)

    She doesn't need dating, she is beyond that. She is hundreds years old and communes with spirits (allegedly)

    At the very least, that's what she tells Apple Bloom. Especially after the Love Poison Incident.

    The rest she will tell when AB is older
    
5. ### _[_18:10_]_Estee_:_

    That's the coward's way out.
    
11. ### _[_18:17_]_FanOfMostEverything_:_ 
    
    Any shaman who can't give the Talk in iambic pentameter isn't worthy of brewing tea. (изменено)
    
12. ### _[_18:19_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    I meant, she will expand on some other, more otherworldly style of wording phrases and juggling meanings
    
13. ### _[_18:19_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Which is more natural to her
