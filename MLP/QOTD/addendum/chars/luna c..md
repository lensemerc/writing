[Tough Leader Façade](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLeaderFacade "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToughLeaderFacade"): Of a different variety to her sis. Whereas Celestia's mask is that of an enlightenment monarch (late renaissance/early modern period), Luna's is that of Dark Ages/Medieval royalty. It's implied that a [grandiose](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeHam") and [intimidating](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuelStationAttendant "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFuelStationAttendant") demeanor was necessary because Equestria used to be a much more savage and inhospitable place and the sisters didn't have the centuries of tradition and religious reverence that they have now. Luna's mask was at odds with her kindly and fun-loving nature.

Eventually I've figured out for myself that she is a growing character, at least if you are going on with canon. She is stubborn, brash, artsy, envious, self-judgemental, but has a good heart and a great compassion for ponies, which can lead her to extremes. She is also can be seen as a mother figure to foals.
If you define her as a [i]younger sister[/i] in the setting, you barely can miss. But it's true that she might seem to be sort of 'underdeveloped', I suppose. Hence the lack of character traits, as this gentlenotponyman pointed out >>7912587


It also does a good job of showing Luna off in a more… I want to say motherly aspect but that isn't quite right. Luna often gets stereotyped as the Princess of War. The dour one, with fell countenance and fury, while Celestia gets to serve the aspect of the counselor and kind parent. It's good to see Luna getting into that, particularly because 'cares for foals' really does mesh well with her proper canon role.

Well, we know her role implicitly is a protective one - the guardian of dreams and such. And actually a surprising amount of her canon interactions are with foals - between her Nightmare Night appearance, connecting with Sweetie Belle, and her scenes in the one where the Princesses switch Marks, she spends a lot of her screen time with them and is usually pretty caring. As opposed to Celestia who basically has zero interaction with non-adults throughout the series, yet is more often portrayed by fanon in a motherly context. (There's a million stories about Celestia acting as Twilight's surrogate mother or as being Sunset Shimmer's _literal_ mother, and yet very few stories with Luna in a similar situation.)

### 15:28_]_Forcalor_:_ 

Luna is also an artsy one/more of a creative type, and those might be in bigger need of stimuli over all. At the same time, the Internet seem to define her as INTJ, and it feels fitting too

1. ### 15:19_]_Logarithmicon_:_ 
    
    If I had to point to one thing, I'd say Luna's flaw is _impulsiveness_. Once she gets something into her head, she tends to Just Do It without consulting anyone or pondering on the consequences.
    
2. ### _[_15:19_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    oh yeah, that's a good one
    
3. ### _[_15:22_]_Logarithmicon_:_ 
    
    (Contrastingly, one of Celestia's is deliberate self-isolation. She'll make a reasonable estimation of the consequences of her actions, sure, but she doesn't tend to _tell_ anyone the full scope of her plans.)
    
4. ### _[_15:24_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    That's a good one too. Picked up on those when was regarding their ability to communicate, that was fun

1. ### 21:31_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    They also identify with her because underneath that she's painted as a little sister that craved attention, turned self-deprecation to absurd levels, and _haven't done anything substantial_
    
2. ### _[_21:31_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    A very relatable character
    
3. ### _[_21:40_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Also I asked around and people seem to struggling to call out her negative character traits at all. I've made a fairly comprehensive notes on that already, but anyone is welcome to have a shot at it
    
4. ### _[_21:44_]_RunicTreetops_:_ 
    
    My comment earlier stemmed from me having done a longer form fic a few weeks ago that was _extremely_ controversial, due in part to my depiction of Nightmare Moon being a cruel, violent manipulator obssessed with power. In other words, much more show accurate than this one, which was made in part due to fan demand and I specifically marked as "AU" due to her being so _out_ of character.
    
5. ### _[_21:48_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Well if you're familiar with controversy, you should be aware already that public's opinion is extremely fickle, so whatever. ![🤔](https://discord.com/assets/1937c18d930227d1cff8.svg)
    
6. ### _[_21:49_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Though it all can work extremely well as a meta-commentary on Luna's problem with love
    
7. ### _[_21:49_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    hmm
    
8. ### _[_21:49_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    _adds to the notes_ actually fascinating stuff

1. ### _[_23:59_]_pseudobob ◶_:_ 
    
    Yeah. And maybe a lot of the horrific history of Nightmare Moon's reign was actually done under Celestia's name, or under whatever government came before. And it just gets remembered that way because it was a confusing time and has since become legend.

4. ### _[_0:00_]_pseudobob ◶_:_ 
    
    One of the most striking things about history is that... sometimes, something incredibly important and noteworthy happens, and nobody knows why
    
5. ### _[_0:01_]_pseudobob ◶_:_ 
    
    The people who would have known are long dead, perhaps died before anyone could have thought to ask them, and may have had their own reasons for keeping quiet or muddying the waters.
    
6. ### _[_0:01_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    Nightmare Moon can be a great pariah in the eyes of history. They could attribute her _any_ shit that was happening one thousand years ago
    
7. ### _[_0:02_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    and a big character trait of Celestia is that she isn't perfect herself

1. ### _[_18:01_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Here's a thought: Luna might be feeling disconnected with reality at times, and not always realizing where dream world and waking world begin and end. Basically her night shift is her wandering in dreams of others, and in canon she sleeps in the day hours
    
2. ### _[_18:08_]_RDT_:_ 
    
    I'm pretty sure Luna still sleeps at night and is awake during the day, canonically
    
3. ### _[_18:10_]_RDT_:_ 
    
    It makes sense though, dreams seem much more real to Luna than to anyone else
    
4. ### _[_18:16_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    I don't think that her acting out her duties can be codified as _rest_ anyway. Show depicts her usually worn out at the morning, as seen in 'A Royal Problem', so I'd presume after that she gets some sleep for own sake (изменено)
    
5. ### _[_18:23_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    also the show's world is either not a planet, or Luna explicitly guards the dreams only of Equestrian ponies for one reason or the other
    
6. ### _[_18:23_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    pretty fun to mull about for worldbuilding too

    In the world where Luna engages in warfare, enemy can sever their connection with the dreamrealm, losing some part of their soul in the process

    I've toyed with the idea, its interesting to explore

Вдохновиться Ветинари из дискворлда
Vetinari has encouraged the growth of the Guilds and public services. The [Ankh-Morpork City Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh-Morpork_City_Watch "Ankh-Morpork City Watch") in particular has flourished, and is an excellent example of the adaptability which has kept Vetinari in office. At the time he rises to power, the Night Watch consists of three incompetents led by a drunk, just how he then wanted it (incapable of fighting crime, which was being efficiently controlled by the government-approved Thieves and Assassins Guilds). The group evolves into a large, efficient, well-oiled machine that facilitates the smooth operation of the city, and that appears to be just how he wants it.

    Who's order?
    
2. ### _[_18:29_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    Vetinari's. He cares about the _City_, not so much the people
    
3. ### _[_18:30_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    Well he cares about himself, he just thinks the best way to stay in power is to bring stability
    
4. ### _[_18:30_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    That's true in Guards, Guards, but that's partly an issue of early installment weirdness
    
5. ### _[_18:31_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    But that's the point. Vetanri had a well run city with a low crime rate without guards. And he did it by legalizing and professionlizing crime and making them have standards. Clay has that all disappear
    
6. ### _[_18:32_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    With the more respectabilty of the Guards
    
7. ### _[_18:32_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    He didn't have a city with a low crime rate, is the point. He had a city where the crime rate was scheduled.
    
8. ### _[_18:32_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    That's not exactly the same thing
    
"I wonder," she said, "whom thou art. Celestia had always such certainty that my brother lived on behind thy eyes, and thou thyself said as much. I thought, 'twas impossible for my brother to become such a monster as thou didst..." She bowed her head. "But then I my own self tried to kill Celestia. I would have brought eternal night. Can I truly judge thee?"

"I know not if this is the right choice," she said softly, looking up at the statue's sightless eyes. "But I will tell Celestia, at last, that thou still livest and thinkest within there. If I know my sister's heart... something will change." She couldn't bear to make him promises, or offers, or even outright speak the words that he might be set free, because if Celestia didn't agree, Luna doubted she would push. Celestia was the one who thought Discord was truly Discord. If she didn't agree that the right thing to do was to find a way to release him, once she knew he was aware... so be it.


Yes! Those labels are perfect - Chrysalis' more primal, more instinctual and visceral side, Luna being the more logical and rational side, and Celestia as the mediator between the two. They are a perfect dynamic for a story about balancing the light and darkness in yourself - the Id, the Ego, the Superego. They are a perfect metaphor. Indeed! Chrysalis is the most instinctive side, Luna is the rational and level-headed side, while Celestia is the balance between those two sides. This should make for an interesting way to write a story - having a balancing act between the three in all their interactions is definitely going to make for an interesting fanfic! I find that this balancing act is often overlooked in writing, so it's refreshing to see someone explore a more complex type of dynamic like this. That's an excellent way of describing it - Chrysalis is definitely the Id, and Luna is definitely the super ego. Celestia is the ego, definitely, she's the median and balancing point between the two. Perhaps there could be a lesson learned for all, about the values of striking the right balance between light and dark? I have a feeling that a story like that would have a lot of powerful moments in it that would really make the reader think.

As an example of butchering names, I recently had her refer to Fancy Pants as "Fancy of Pants". 

From Show:  
"Remember this day, little ponies, for it was your last. From this moment forth, the night will last forever!"  
"Child. Art thou saying that thou... likest me to scare you?"  
"A warm welcome to you, Scootaloo."  
"I understand what you're going through, Sweetie Belle. I, too, have a sister who often shines more brightly than me, and with this I have struggled."


Huzzah, that's a great help, thank thee kindly  
Personally I've found overreliance on old english and weird speech patterns a bit obtuse though. It seems to have most sense when she is acting childish or in a familiar setting. Maybe it can be played as something she is subconsciously slips into now and then

In the show she grows out of it eventually, and that's a plus

https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/73903/when-should-i-say-thee

In modern English usage, we don't use the second-person singular; what we use in its place is essentially the second-person plural - so it's not just Southerners who call each other "you-all"; we all do it! To see what I mean by this, consider the standard conjugation diagram, as seen in countless "501 xxxxish Verbs" books:

Modern English usage:

```
I    am   we   are   I    have  we   have    I    will  we   will   I   do    we   do
you  are  you  are   you  have  you  have    you  will  you  will   you do    you  do
he   is   they are   he   has   they have    he   will  they will   he  does  they do
```

Old usage:

```
I    am   we   are   I    have  we   have    I    will  we   will   I    do    we   do
thou art  you  are   thou hast  you  have    thou wilt  you  will   thou dost  you  do
he   is   they are   he   has   they have    he   will  they will   he   does  they do
```

In modern usage, we also use "you" as both the subject pronoun (who's doing it?) and the object pronoun (to whom is it being done?) Formerly, in the second-person singular, "thou" would be the subject pronoun, and "thee" would be the object pronoun:

> Modern: I love **you**. Do **you** love me?  
> Old: I love **thee**. Dost **thou** love me?

Finally, **thy** and **thine** are the second-person singular equivalents of **your** and **yours**. To help you remember when to use which, try substituting "my" and "mine" instead.

> **Thy** chair is on the right.  
> The chair on the right is **thine**.

**Thine** and **mine** are used in place of **thy** or **my** before a vowel sound, just like **a** and **an**.

> This is **a** cap.  
> This is **an** apple.
> 
> This is **my** cap.  
> This is **mine** apple.
> 
> This is **thy** cap.  
> This is **thine** apple.
