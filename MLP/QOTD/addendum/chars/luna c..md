Thou hast been/Thou must be proud/Thou hast given/
I congratulate thy daughter/I hath patiently observed thy parenting/Thy actions alone will
I entrust thee with this child/It is all up to thee

1. ### _[_18:01_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Here's a thought: Luna might be feeling disconnected with reality at times, and not always realizing where dream world and waking world begin and end. Basically her night shift is her wandering in dreams of others, and in canon she sleeps in the day hours
    
2. ### _[_18:08_]_RDT_:_ 
    
    I'm pretty sure Luna still sleeps at night and is awake during the day, canonically
    
3. ### _[_18:10_]_RDT_:_ 
    
    It makes sense though, dreams seem much more real to Luna than to anyone else
    
4. ### _[_18:16_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    I don't think that her acting out her duties can be codified as _rest_ anyway. Show depicts her usually worn out at the morning, as seen in 'A Royal Problem', so I'd presume after that she gets some sleep for own sake (изменено)
    
5. ### _[_18:23_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    also the show's world is either not a planet, or Luna explicitly guards the dreams only of Equestrian ponies for one reason or the other
    
6. ### _[_18:23_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    pretty fun to mull about for worldbuilding too

1. ### 22:53_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    In the world where Luna engages in warfare, enemy can sever their connection with the dreamrealm, losing some part of their soul in the process
    
2. ### _[_22:54_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    I've toyed with the idea, its interesting to explore
    
3. ### _[_22:54_]_pseudobob (arcless)_:_ 
    
    Luckily, if you're deep into a habit, by bedtime you'll actually be tired and probably won't want to write
    
4. ### _[_22:54_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    (by that I mean, I plan to write it in sometime)

Вдохновиться Ветинари из дискворлда
Vetinari has encouraged the growth of the Guilds and public services. The [Ankh-Morpork City Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh-Morpork_City_Watch "Ankh-Morpork City Watch") in particular has flourished, and is an excellent example of the adaptability which has kept Vetinari in office. At the time he rises to power, the Night Watch consists of three incompetents led by a drunk, just how he then wanted it (incapable of fighting crime, which was being efficiently controlled by the government-approved Thieves and Assassins Guilds). The group evolves into a large, efficient, well-oiled machine that facilitates the smooth operation of the city, and that appears to be just how he wants it.

1. ### _[_18:29_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    Who's order?
    
2. ### _[_18:29_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    Vetinari's. He cares about the _City_, not so much the people
    
3. ### _[_18:30_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    Well he cares about himself, he just thinks the best way to stay in power is to bring stability
    
4. ### _[_18:30_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    That's true in Guards, Guards, but that's partly an issue of early installment weirdness
    
5. ### _[_18:31_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    But that's the point. Vetanri had a well run city with a low crime rate without guards. And he did it by legalizing and professionlizing crime and making them have standards. Clay has that all disappear
    
6. ### _[_18:32_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    With the more respectabilty of the Guards
    
7. ### _[_18:32_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    He didn't have a city with a low crime rate, is the point. He had a city where the crime rate was scheduled.
    
8. ### _[_18:32_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    That's not exactly the same thing
    
"I wonder," she said, "whom thou art. Celestia had always such certainty that my brother lived on behind thy eyes, and thou thyself said as much. I thought, 'twas impossible for my brother to become such a monster as thou didst..." She bowed her head. "But then I my own self tried to kill Celestia. I would have brought eternal night. Can I truly judge thee?"

"I know not if this is the right choice," she said softly, looking up at the statue's sightless eyes. "But I will tell Celestia, at last, that thou still livest and thinkest within there. If I know my sister's heart... something will change." She couldn't bear to make him promises, or offers, or even outright speak the words that he might be set free, because if Celestia didn't agree, Luna doubted she would push. Celestia was the one who thought Discord was truly Discord. If she didn't agree that the right thing to do was to find a way to release him, once she knew he was aware... so be it.
