Thou hast been/Thou must be proud/Thou hast given/
I congratulate thy daughter/I hath patiently observed thy parenting/Thy actions alone will
I entrust thee with this child/It is all up to thee

Вдохновиться Ветинари из дискворлда
Vetinari has encouraged the growth of the Guilds and public services. The [Ankh-Morpork City Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankh-Morpork_City_Watch "Ankh-Morpork City Watch") in particular has flourished, and is an excellent example of the adaptability which has kept Vetinari in office. At the time he rises to power, the Night Watch consists of three incompetents led by a drunk, just how he then wanted it (incapable of fighting crime, which was being efficiently controlled by the government-approved Thieves and Assassins Guilds). The group evolves into a large, efficient, well-oiled machine that facilitates the smooth operation of the city, and that appears to be just how he wants it.

1. ### _[_18:29_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    Who's order?
    
2. ### _[_18:29_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    Vetinari's. He cares about the _City_, not so much the people
    
3. ### _[_18:30_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    Well he cares about himself, he just thinks the best way to stay in power is to bring stability
    
4. ### _[_18:30_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    That's true in Guards, Guards, but that's partly an issue of early installment weirdness
    
5. ### _[_18:31_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    But that's the point. Vetanri had a well run city with a low crime rate without guards. And he did it by legalizing and professionlizing crime and making them have standards. Clay has that all disappear
    
6. ### _[_18:32_]_nlinzer_:_ 
    
    With the more respectabilty of the Guards
    
7. ### _[_18:32_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    He didn't have a city with a low crime rate, is the point. He had a city where the crime rate was scheduled.
    
8. ### _[_18:32_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    That's not exactly the same thing
