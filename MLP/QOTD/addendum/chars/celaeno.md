    I like that she has clearly used and worn-out sword
    
2. ### _[_22:59_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    MLP movie was metal
    
3. ### _[_23:00_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    Oh, and one leg
    
4. ### _[_23:00_]_Forcalor_:_ 
    
    nice
    
5. ### _[_23:00_]_Mishkiel_:_ 
    
    It gets better. That "peg" is a blade too
    
6. ### _[_23:01_]_LurksNoMore_:_ 
    
    It's a crystal peg-leg!
    
7. ### _[_23:01_]_LurksNoMore_:_ 
    
    Celaeno and the pirate parrots are underused, IMO.
    
8. ### _[_23:01_]_LurksNoMore_:_ 
    
    Seaponies and hippogriffs get plenty of love, which is fine, they're neat. But I'd love to see some more stuff on the birds. And the Abyssinians. And the various weird Klugetowners.


1. ### _[_21:49_]_Scriblits Talo_:_ 
    
    Start navigation is a good one
    
2. ### _[_21:49_]_Scriblits Talo_:_ 
    
    I might have to do something with that
    
3. ### _[_21:56_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    different gravitational pull zones... anomalies...
    
4. ### _[_21:57_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    _whispers from the stars_, caught by transmissions
    
5. ### _[_21:57_]_Scriblits Talo_:_ 
    
    Ooo
    
6. ### _[_21:57_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    ships, dissappearing by time distortions
    
7. ### _[_21:57_]_Scriblits Talo_:_ 
    
    The horror of gasping for breath as your ship runs out of oxygen
    
8. ### _[_21:58_]_Scriblits Talo_:_ 
    
    Worse yet being too dumb to guess for breath as the oxygen deprivation gets to your brain
    
9. ### _[_21:58_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    air bubbles? I want not to bother with oxygen, kinda still Equestrian space atmosphere
    
10. ### _[_21:59_]_Scriblits Talo_:_ 
    
    Fair enough
    
11. ### _[_21:59_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    hence the ships can't fly upwards or sink too low
    
12. ### _[_21:59_]_Scriblits Talo_:_ 
    
    Part of the joy of fantasy
    
13. ### _[_22:04_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    have to look into spelljammer or something of the like for further inspiration
    
14. ### _[_22:04_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    also there might be a different exposure to elements
    
15. ### _[_22:05_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    warmth/cold, maybe something varies due to position of celestial objects
    
16. ### _[_22:06_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    how fauna would react to that, and what fauna there even is
    
17. ### _[_22:08_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    maybe there is an uninhabitable freezing zone along the border of the world so the voyagers need to get inside the airtight ship hulk until they clear it
    
18. ### _[_22:08_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    that kind of stuff
    
19. ### _[_22:23_]_Scriblits Talo_:_ 
    
    Nice!

    Can you expound on that?
    
    ### _[_0:16_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    In what regard?
    
24. ### _[_0:17_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    Maybe later anyway, I'm not in a rush and it is late in here. A working title for story with this so far is 'The Ship of The Prince of Void'
    
25. ### _[_0:18_]_Scriblits Talo_:_ 
    
    Just curious where your going with it Love the title
    
26. ### _[_0:19_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    With Captain Celaeno, with hanging talking cut-off head of Pinkie Pie on her waist, confronting the son of Storm King. In space (изменено)
    
27. ### _[_0:20_]_Scriblits Talo_:_ 
    
    Intriguing
