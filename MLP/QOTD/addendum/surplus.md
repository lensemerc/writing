[Promising Cadence]



"It isn't my real family. 

I don't know what will happen when I smash it,"

"I-I won't. I know that this village doesn't love me, not really. I'm just pleasant to be around, that is all," she sniffed, "They don't need me. You, right now... You do."

"Will you leave me too?"

"No, I won't. I-I don't have anyone else either. I just woke up in the forest one day..."

A miserable little shack

lacerations on hooves

Prismia hacked until her hooves were on verge of giving out.
Like a wingless angel of death разрушает свою избу



 Prismia was like a beast, destroying all her life's wok
Filly was gone. Was she even real? Prismia wasn't sure. It mattered little.

жители деревни понемногу выходят и смотрят на Призмию


  
  
  exquisite abstractions, embroidered with richness of mathematics of emotion

what is wrong with her? She laughed bitterly over her own demise and downfall. She is nothing more but her own executioner...
She laughed and laughed still, as her shoulders sagged and she pressed down on the ground.  That is how ponies found her. They were carrying pitchforks and lanterns. She welcomed the sight.

"Look at what you've done to me!" she howled desperately, fervently wishing for it all to be ended already.


"Why do you cry?"

she was stepping slowly, shrugging the ash from her wings one by one.
Выходит из огня разрушающейся избы

"Please-please do not cry..."






Prismia pushed her with all feeble strength, and little filly

all she accrued

Humming, embittering
knowing no tune 

Spoken hush, with no love at all.
Alone she roams, that crooked vile hag
the despicable crone
the despicable crone

See how under the gaze of the beguiling moon
She creepily creeps and hums with no tune.
Just like she took 
a lock of the hair,
a page from a diary,
a trinket from shelf,
a small stuffed toy.

I had to go places far out of the sight
I've sought for a knowledge

But all sensetiveness, all essence and heart,

All of the ponies, of course, meant her well,


Evaporated like dew

Soon, one gleamy dreamy night,
(when every pony gets a fright)

But she's all sensetiveness,

Her lingering thoughts remained true.

Some people remind me of sharp dazzling diamonds. Valuable but lifeless and loveless. Others, of the simplest field flowers, with hearts full of dew and with all the tints of celestial beauty reflected in their modest petals.

You're all sensitiveness, you're the flower of everything, you're stylization, the perfume and essence of all things.

Spewing

'Prismia', she had been called nowadays. Just 'Prismia'. Long ago she was someone to be feared, and revered, and cherished. Stallions were at their knees at her hooves, her wit and intellect was unparalleled, she was in Canterlot's finest circles... Now, the thing that remained was but a mere shadow of her old self. 

The envy, that's what secured her downfall back then. That what brought her down. Their plotting and scheming, they all wanted to see her in this misery and squalor. 


Dragonscale and some gems


Just some nameless orphan child. You don't even do anything!



"Get away from me!" she raspily demanded, and smashed a hoof on her face

It wasn't genuine
All of it wasn't genuine
It will never be genuine 

"It is never too late to open your heart again," she whispered, "It is not your past that keeps it closed, only you."

"What do you even know..."

It is making pies for all to enjoy... It is reading a book on a hot summer day... It is everything, and I think you deserve it


[23:08]Flovv Krovv: Она обнимает Призмию, но та ударяет её в итоге
Затем она смотрит на свои копыта: When I became like this? 
[23:14]Flovv Krovv: Машина по пожиранию любви. Деревья начинают высыхать вокруг

An apparition, magnificent and angelic, standing taller that any pony she ever saw before

"Congratulations, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza..." she said in a gentle and beautiful voice, sending goosebumps of joy down filly's spine, filling her with sensation of *purpose*, "Now. Rise."
