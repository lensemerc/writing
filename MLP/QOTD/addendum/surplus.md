"That's not the whole truth."

"Something did went awry with your plans, right? Something... Something is very wrong."




"You wouldn't banish me to limbo, or punish somehow?"

"Preposterous."










Silence hung heavy in the air. Then, he spoke: "Yes, of course I am afraid." His features creased into a grim determined look. 



Starlight began to hyperventilate. She took a step back, sweat dripped down her forehead. Seeing this change, Starswirl stiffened, looking more intently than ever.

Старлайт в ужасе, 


"Why that tree is so still? Is that a real tree? A projection? What is it?"




Starswirl shrugged, and the portal collapsed into nothingness, "Well, such is a fate of choice. Now..."

"And that is why there exist ponies like me, or Celestia, or Luna, or Twilight, so no one else would be forced to make these sacrifices,"


"Hope you are enjoying your little bipedal universe," he replied

"Would've enjoy it more, if you weren't tossing out there your own screw-ups, like the sirens," she growled back.

Starswirl rolled his eyes.


"Starlight. Hey." She placed hoof on Starlight's shoulder, 

"What if he's right?" She replied weakly, "What if it is really only correct way forward? To hold it all together?"

Edge of peace







I've always put Twilight, Starlight, and Sunset on the same power level - but the difference is in perspectives and how they utilize that power. Twilight spent her entire life holding back. She's been taught restraint, there's points where she actively fears her power, and she loses control when confronted with _truly_ high power levels until fairly late in the series. 
Starlight is self-taught and has never faced another pony who's even _vaguely_ on her level until she meets Twilight. She's a sledgehammer and that works fine for her. Raw blunt magical force has always worked for her, and she leans into it. (This is why she's able to match Twilight: she's going full force while Twilight is holding back.) 
Sunset, for a third perspective, has power but leans more into trickery and guile. Where Starlight never faced and equal, Sunset _always_ saw herself as weak because her every action was compared to Celestia. So she was never strong enough so instead she's all about novel approaches, edge cases, and elaborate plans. (Right up until she gets the Element, which she deems 'enough' and goes whole hog.)

1. ### 17:43_]_FanOfMostEverything_:_ 
    
    Twilight is blue. Magic is means by which she expands her knowledge and refines her craft, a tool she can employ (and can sometimes rely too much on) in pursuit of self-improvement, whether she defines that by being the best living spellbook imaginable or a good friend.
    
2. ### _[_17:45_]_FanOfMostEverything_:_ 
    
    Starlight is red. She is impulsive, she explicitly draws power from her emotions, and she _deeply_ resents being told what to do something she doesn't feel is right. She throws everything she has into what she does just because that's who she is. Middle gears are for ponies willing to compromise. Starlight needs an apocalypse rubbed in her muzzle before she can even consider she has the wrong idea.
    
3. ### _[_17:47_]_FanOfMostEverything_:_ 
    
    Sunset is the middle ground between them, the shared ally bridging the gap. In other words, she's black. Where Twilight uses magic for self-improvement, Sunset uses it for self _advancement_, furthering concrete ambitions (even when they're positive intentions) rather than an abstract, indeterminate goal of "getting better." She's not afraid to go all in, but it's for a purpose rather than simply because she refuses any other option.

Feelings of dread, 

Starlight is always making excuses to keep from having to learn more friendship lessons, and has outright denied growing like when she didn't want to leave Twilight too early after the changeling's second invasion. Sunset is very similar, and is always trying to charge herself with the responsibility of helping out wherever she can. But when it comes time to ask for help, she wants to be able to do it on her own

[9:04]Forcalor: Would you say that she is prone to take charge in situations at least, and more of a type of proactive, not reactive, protagonist? 
[9:05]Forcalor: (though protagonists usually react anyway) 
[9:09]EileenSaysHi: To an extent, but part of her growth is learning that she’s not always the most important person in the room, and that being a cheerleader for her friends has a worth of its own.
[9:10]EileenSaysHi: I’ve enjoyed the way EqG takes a more egalitarian approach to who plays leader in any given special, as opposed to FiM becoming the Twilight show anytime the bad guy is sufficiently big.

"Could I come from a parallel universe?" Sunset nervously offered.

"It might be plausible," Starlight rubbed her chin, frowning, but Starswirl shook his beard decisively:

"Absolutely not."

"But why?" Sunset blinked, "Everything is so different, that's gotta be it!"

"No," he replied combatively, "More likely something had scrambled your memories, than something like [i]that[/i] occured."

Behind his tone, Sunset noticed thoroughly concealed fear, and nodded just to placate the old guy. If he's so alarmed, she'll just try to fish the information from him later.

"Will you leave me too?"

She laughed and laughed still, as her shoulders sagged and she pressed down on the ground.  That is how ponies found her. They were carrying pitchforks and lanterns. She welcomed the sight.

"Look at what you've done to me!" she howled desperately, fervently wishing for it all to be ended already.

'Prismia', she had been called nowadays. Just 'Prismia'. Long ago she was someone to be feared, and revered, and cherished. Stallions were at their knees at her hooves, her wit and intellect was unparalleled, she was in Canterlot's finest circles... Now, the thing that remained was but a mere shadow of her old self. 

The envy, that's what secured her downfall back then. That what brought her down. Their plotting and scheming, they all wanted to see her in this misery and squalor.

mix of relief and triumph washed over her

Она летит в невидимости, пытаясь разглядеть хоть что-нибудь. Затем, будто бы по волшебству, облака расчищаются и Луна светит ярко.

Skies cleared up and she gasped in astonishment, looking at clear Moon and Her light, at all magnificent stars. It was a miracle.

As if unseen force was helping her.

"My knight"

"Celestia is under her control?"

"I do not know."


"Stay with me," she whispered to Shining

"She... Twilight..." Shining chuckled deliriously.

"Celestia... turned Twilight to stone."

"What?" 

"To stone, dove."

"But why?"  Why would she do that?"

Canterlot looked unfamiliar.

She stiffened, leaning on Shining. 




It was exceedingly rare feeling for Cadance, to have such strong repugnancy to any of living creatures. 

Cadance was filled with loathing.

13:42]Flovv Krovv: Каданс и Шайнинг сражаются спиной к спине, пока не остаются только они двое. Шайнинг перезаряжает арбалет, Каданс прикрывает их обоих магическим щитом. Чейнджлинги ударяются о него, пытаясь пробить.

– Находясь в жопе, ты можешь сделать две вещи.  
  
Во-первых – постараться понять, почему ты в ней находишься.  
Во-вторых – вылезти оттуда.  
  
Ошибка отдельных людей и целых народов в том, что они думают, будто эти два действия как-то связаны между собой. А это не так. И вылезти из жопы гораздо проще, чем понять, почему ты в ней находишься.  
  
– Почему?  
  
– Вылезти из жопы надо всего один раз, и после этого про нее можно забыть. А чтобы понять, почему ты в ней находишься, нужна вся жизнь. Которую ты в ней и проведешь.

It was something that Cadance was directly struggling with for all of her life. As she discovered in time, love in many respects was about managing fear in yourself and in others. Fear of expectations, of relations, of responsibility, of trust... Love was just as deep and intricate as fear, and two emotions couldn't be more entwined and be different of each other at the same time. 


A toy, mounted on his wrist.

"Think I'll go say old Chryssie 'hi' myself,"

"Twilight will manage," she repeated the same thing she told to the girls before, and then felt a sting of conscience. 

"I'll just make sure that she will," her husband smiled warmly, "It'll be easy. One hoof there, and one hoof here, you know how it goes."

"I'm coming with," she said resolutely.

"No, you will stay back for Flurry's sake. 'sides, Crystal Ponies will go bonkers if they lose their Crystal Princess. "

 He was right, she needed to admit. Instead, she clenched her teeth and looked directly in his eye.

"You are a fool."

"Yeah," he hummed, keeping gearing up.

"Why are you always making it all so complicated?"

"Yeah."

"You're completely not thinking about me. About us."

"M-hm."

Cadance made a long exasperated groan. She leaned forward, looked deeply into the Shining's eyes: "Why I married so heartless bastard? You're absolutely despicable."

"Because you love me." He pecked her cheek, passing along. She made a subtle step after him

"No, I hate you. Hate you. You hear?"

He smiled with that foolish smile, that fooly fool. He grabbed the sword, tested how it slides out of sheath, and turned away. 
"So, will it be the last words that you've ever said to your husband?"

"Yeah!" She smiled widely, tearing up. "Come back alive for better ones, you fool."

He chuckled, glanced at her mischievously over the shoulder, and simply nodded.

Каданс ненавидит чейнджлингов


Cadance: "I am a diplomat, and war is merely a method of diplomacy. Maybe the least effective one, but with you, monsters, it will suffice." 
Changeling: "You got it all mixed up, morsel. War is a **hunger**... For creatures like us, hunger is never satisfied... We always at war with you."


Про то что делают чейнджлинги с захваченными (как думает Каданс)

"Queen of Equestria demands your surrender, ponykind. You will be looked upon well."

Soon, the waiting began to gnaw on her immensely.

Стигиан пытается отговорить Каданс бросаться в город, но она его не слушает

Dear Celestia, how Cadance hated changelings.
Disgusting creatures.


"How can such creatures even exist?"

No honor...


Her movements were fluid and graceful, yet also powerful and precise.



[23:01]Flovv Krovv: Каданс видит луч вырвавшийся из замка, и испугавшись за Шайнинга, бежит спасать

Чейнджлинги загоняют в угол Каданс и Шайнинга, они теряются среди них
