"That's not the whole truth."

"Something did went awry with your plans, right? Something... Something is very wrong."




"You wouldn't banish me to limbo, or punish somehow?"

"Preposterous."










Silence hung heavy in the air. Then, he spoke: "Yes, of course I am afraid." His features creased into a grim determined look. 



Starlight began to hyperventilate. She took a step back, sweat dripped down her forehead. Seeing this change, Starswirl stiffened, looking more intently than ever.

Старлайт в ужасе, 


"Why that tree is so still? Is that a real tree? A projection? What is it?"




Starswirl shrugged, and the portal collapsed into nothingness, "Well, such is a fate of choice. Now..."

"And that is why there exist ponies like me, or Celestia, or Luna, or Twilight, so no one else would be forced to make these sacrifices,"


"Hope you are enjoying your little bipedal universe," he replied

"Would've enjoy it more, if you weren't tossing out there your own screw-ups, like the sirens," she growled back.

Starswirl rolled his eyes.


"Starlight. Hey." She placed hoof on Starlight's shoulder, 

"What if he's right?" She replied weakly, "What if it is really only correct way forward? To hold it all together?"

Edge of peace







I've always put Twilight, Starlight, and Sunset on the same power level - but the difference is in perspectives and how they utilize that power. Twilight spent her entire life holding back. She's been taught restraint, there's points where she actively fears her power, and she loses control when confronted with _truly_ high power levels until fairly late in the series. 
Starlight is self-taught and has never faced another pony who's even _vaguely_ on her level until she meets Twilight. She's a sledgehammer and that works fine for her. Raw blunt magical force has always worked for her, and she leans into it. (This is why she's able to match Twilight: she's going full force while Twilight is holding back.) 
Sunset, for a third perspective, has power but leans more into trickery and guile. Where Starlight never faced and equal, Sunset _always_ saw herself as weak because her every action was compared to Celestia. So she was never strong enough so instead she's all about novel approaches, edge cases, and elaborate plans. (Right up until she gets the Element, which she deems 'enough' and goes whole hog.)

1. ### 17:43_]_FanOfMostEverything_:_ 
    
    Twilight is blue. Magic is means by which she expands her knowledge and refines her craft, a tool she can employ (and can sometimes rely too much on) in pursuit of self-improvement, whether she defines that by being the best living spellbook imaginable or a good friend.
    
2. ### _[_17:45_]_FanOfMostEverything_:_ 
    
    Starlight is red. She is impulsive, she explicitly draws power from her emotions, and she _deeply_ resents being told what to do something she doesn't feel is right. She throws everything she has into what she does just because that's who she is. Middle gears are for ponies willing to compromise. Starlight needs an apocalypse rubbed in her muzzle before she can even consider she has the wrong idea.
    
3. ### _[_17:47_]_FanOfMostEverything_:_ 
    
    Sunset is the middle ground between them, the shared ally bridging the gap. In other words, she's black. Where Twilight uses magic for self-improvement, Sunset uses it for self _advancement_, furthering concrete ambitions (even when they're positive intentions) rather than an abstract, indeterminate goal of "getting better." She's not afraid to go all in, but it's for a purpose rather than simply because she refuses any other option.

Feelings of dread, 

Starlight is always making excuses to keep from having to learn more friendship lessons, and has outright denied growing like when she didn't want to leave Twilight too early after the changeling's second invasion. Sunset is very similar, and is always trying to charge herself with the responsibility of helping out wherever she can. But when it comes time to ask for help, she wants to be able to do it on her own

[9:04]Forcalor: Would you say that she is prone to take charge in situations at least, and more of a type of proactive, not reactive, protagonist? 
[9:05]Forcalor: (though protagonists usually react anyway) 
[9:09]EileenSaysHi: To an extent, but part of her growth is learning that she’s not always the most important person in the room, and that being a cheerleader for her friends has a worth of its own.
[9:10]EileenSaysHi: I’ve enjoyed the way EqG takes a more egalitarian approach to who plays leader in any given special, as opposed to FiM becoming the Twilight show anytime the bad guy is sufficiently big.

"Could I come from a parallel universe?" Sunset nervously offered.

"It might be plausible," Starlight rubbed her chin, frowning, but Starswirl shook his beard decisively:

"Absolutely not."

"But why?" Sunset blinked, "Everything is so different, that's gotta be it!"

"No," he replied combatively, "More likely something had scrambled your memories, than something like [i]that[/i] occured."

Behind his tone, Sunset noticed thoroughly concealed fear, and nodded just to placate the old guy. If he's so alarmed, she'll just try to fish the information from him later.

"Will you leave me too?"

She laughed and laughed still, as her shoulders sagged and she pressed down on the ground.  That is how ponies found her. They were carrying pitchforks and lanterns. She welcomed the sight.

"Look at what you've done to me!" she howled desperately, fervently wishing for it all to be ended already.

'Prismia', she had been called nowadays. Just 'Prismia'. Long ago she was someone to be feared, and revered, and cherished. Stallions were at their knees at her hooves, her wit and intellect was unparalleled, she was in Canterlot's finest circles... Now, the thing that remained was but a mere shadow of her old self. 

The envy, that's what secured her downfall back then. That what brought her down. Their plotting and scheming, they all wanted to see her in this misery and squalor.

mix of relief and triumph washed over her

Она летит в невидимости, пытаясь разглядеть хоть что-нибудь. Затем, будто бы по волшебству, облака расчищаются и Луна светит ярко.

Skies cleared up and she gasped in astonishment, looking at clear Moon and Her light, at all magnificent stars. It was a miracle.

As if unseen force was helping her.

"My knight"

"Celestia is under her control?"

"I do not know."


"Stay with me," she whispered to Shining

"She... Twilight..." Shining chuckled deliriously.

"Celestia... turned Twilight to stone."

"What?" 

"To stone, dove."

"But why?"  Why would she do that?"

Canterlot looked unfamiliar.

She stiffened, leaning on Shining. 




It was exceedingly rare feeling for Cadance, to have such strong repugnancy to any of living creatures. 

Cadance was filled with loathing.

13:42]Flovv Krovv: Каданс и Шайнинг сражаются спиной к спине, пока не остаются только они двое. Шайнинг перезаряжает арбалет, Каданс прикрывает их обоих магическим щитом. Чейнджлинги ударяются о него, пытаясь пробить.

– Находясь в жопе, ты можешь сделать две вещи.  
  
Во-первых – постараться понять, почему ты в ней находишься.  
Во-вторых – вылезти оттуда.  
  
Ошибка отдельных людей и целых народов в том, что они думают, будто эти два действия как-то связаны между собой. А это не так. И вылезти из жопы гораздо проще, чем понять, почему ты в ней находишься.  
  
– Почему?  
  
– Вылезти из жопы надо всего один раз, и после этого про нее можно забыть. А чтобы понять, почему ты в ней находишься, нужна вся жизнь. Которую ты в ней и проведешь.

It was something that Cadance was directly struggling with for all of her life. As she discovered in time, love in many respects was about managing fear in yourself and in others. Fear of expectations, of relations, of responsibility, of trust... Love was just as deep and intricate as fear, and two emotions couldn't be more entwined and be different of each other at the same time. 


A toy, mounted on his wrist.

"Think I'll go say old Chryssie 'hi' myself,"

"Twilight will manage," she repeated the same thing she told to the girls before, and then felt a sting of conscience. 

"I'll just make sure that she will," her husband smiled warmly, "It'll be easy. One hoof there, and one hoof here, you know how it goes."

"I'm coming with," she said resolutely.

"No, you will stay back for Flurry's sake. 'sides, Crystal Ponies will go bonkers if they lose their Crystal Princess. "

 He was right, she needed to admit. Instead, she clenched her teeth and looked directly in his eye.

"You are a fool."

"Yeah," he hummed, keeping gearing up.

"Why are you always making it all so complicated?"

"Yeah."

"You're completely not thinking about me. About us."

"M-hm."

Cadance made a long exasperated groan. She leaned forward, looked deeply into the Shining's eyes: "Why I married so heartless bastard? You're absolutely despicable."

"Because you love me." He pecked her cheek, passing along. She made a subtle step after him

"No, I hate you. Hate you. You hear?"

He smiled with that foolish smile, that fooly fool. He grabbed the sword, tested how it slides out of sheath, and turned away. 
"So, will it be the last words that you've ever said to your husband?"

"Yeah!" She smiled widely, tearing up. "Come back alive for better ones, you fool."

He chuckled, glanced at her mischievously over the shoulder, and simply nodded.

Cadance: "I am a diplomat, and war is merely a method of diplomacy. Maybe the least effective one, but with you, monsters, it will suffice." 
Changeling: "You got it all mixed up, morsel. War is a **hunger**... For creatures like us, hunger is never satisfied... We always at war with you."

"Queen of Equestria demands your surrender, ponykind. You will be looked upon well."

*Chrysalis chuckles softly, her voice like an elegant feline's.* "So, you're the queen, and what does this make me..? Your *subject*? Your inferior? I'm no such thing. I am the more mature, intelligent, and independent changeling. I am not bound by anything. My feelings are my own and I act on what I like. I follow no one..."


Empty mirror only shows what's left inside... No longer will I pretend the staircase I descend will lead anywhere but my unscripted end ... / ... back up the stairs again, I am a different man. Broken mirror only shows as best it can, running in shoes that shine in blood that isn't mine"

`"Ah, but there's nothing special in cruelty... Even the children can be cruel, you know... More than that, I'd wager, the children might be the most cruel creatures in existence. They can [b]explore[/b]. They are seldom aware of how far they can [b]go[/b]."`

Celestia felt that her lips dried up, all of the sudden. "So let me ask you, since we are all in this together, why not [i]strive[/i] to be kind and considerate to one another? Is it really so bad—despite [i]everything[/i] that defined us in the past, despite all doubts—to try?"

"Had you ever felt the weight of responsibility, Chrysalis? Do you ever acted like the Queen, not mimicking one?"


You will destroy the realm, doom everyone.


"Most are afraid of their emotions, Celestia. You shouldn't be. Not you..." 

 Let it be no one to rely on, and no one who'd rely on you." Chrysalis uttered with a demand of fire in her eyes: "Let us burn."

, and in this vulnerability she saw the freedom of the unknown.



Maybe you're just more into mares, with all that longing for your little sister?... Or maybe in your heart of hearts you want [b]all[/b] of your little ponies to worship you more intimately, indiscriminately?..."

Strange acute nature of the shapeshifting beast could led it to latch on every movement that could speak volumes of sheer contempt, rising in the alicorn Princess with every word. Seemingly, Chrysalis was enjoying it nonetheless. 

Lack of outburst was a reaction enough for her, and so she kept talking slowly, with happy green eyes: "What, not even them, my infallible demigoddess? Maybe you would want to indulge into something more innocent? I can make anything happen, and we could keep it as our personal secret. So, how about small precious colts—"

"How [i]dare[/i] you presume something like [i]that[/i] about me, and disgrace me with your presence?" Celestia stopped holding back. She took a step, her great wings flared. "[i]Get out of my sight,[/i] you [i]mongrel[/i]."

and vehemently grinned: "Maybe... Maybe you would want stallions? I can [b]arrange[/b] that... Big, beautiful, they will serve you like a [b]divine[/b] being you are. For you, all for you... We can even go above and beyond and do without my spawn. Only exotic, finest equine [b]breed[/b]. All natural. My treat."

Harmony is a state of equilibrium and balance. It is an alignment of various opposite forces and energies to create a stable and harmonious whole. It is an interplay between two or more opposite elements, each contributing to create harmony in their own unique way. The harmony between the sun and the moon allows life to flourish in Equestria, the harmony between the four alicorns allows friendship and love to prevail, and so forth. Harmony is a fundamental concept in the philosophy and understanding of magic, friendship and the world in general.



Ponies are amusing. They are full of mouthwatering innocence.
When I roamed and rampaged through different realms of ponies, I appreciated how often they are reflections of their rulers.
This one is yours. Beautiful, secluded, soft and vast, and yet with nestled fire within. So full of love and unspent vigor...

"Do you think that they care about your precious harmony?"



Adrenaline pumped in her veins.


There was a possibility of wiping her spawn completely from the face of this world... Celestia smirked. This predator will break the teeth on the hides of her ponies... Wouldn't be the first time.


"They are capable to feel compassion?"

"They are capable of everything that your ponies are, and even [b]more[/b]... Jealous, Celestia?"

Celestia was horrified.

Usually the losses of loved ones in Equestria were handled with private ceremonies, accompanied by 

Ponies usually mourn the death of their loved ones with private ceremonies. They often perform special songs and eulogies. Friends and family usually come to the ceremonies to support the grieving ponies. Ponies who have lost the ones they love are often sad but try to support each other in the difficult time. Some ponies find their solace in prayers, while others find it by reflecting on their loved one's life. Ponies understand that life is short and time is precious. So sometimes it is better to not waste too much time on sorrow and to let love live on even in the darkness of loss.

Ponies traditionally honor the dead by laying flowers and memorial wreaths at the grave, while some also burn candles in memory of the departed. There is also a tradition of holding wakes, where ponies come together to share fond memories and stories of the deceased, to honor and remember their life.

it is customary to hold a 'final feast' for them. They gather all of their friends and family to feast in honor, and to remember what their presence meant. They also pray for them to find rest in the afterlife. The ceremony is viewed as a dark reflection of a wedding.

Tartarus is seen by ponies as a place where fallen ponies have their sins punished. 

When a pony dies, it is believed that their soul is reunited with the magic of Equestria. Their spirit then roams throughout the land, watching over their kin as they grow and prosper, until the time finally comes for them to reincarnate and be reborn in the body of a foal.

Ponies generally hold ceremonies and festivities such as birthdays, anniversaries and weddings, and there are also traditional annual celebrations, such as Hearthswarming Eve and Nightmare Night.

"I'm in it for [b]love[/b], I'm not a [b]sadist![/b]" "Well, maybe just a little, when I want to. If only you knew how liberating it feels to not being confined to anything... To do whatever you want."

"You act as if you truly comprehend your choices and know what you're going to do. It's a facade, Chrysalis. There is no true freedom in the world. There isn't a single soul that isn't confined, as you say, to something, if only by virtue of their birth."

The time had slowed down to a crawl.

Her coat was trembling. It was so unusual, but she [i]welcomed[/i] the feeling. It was... going through every sinew and fiber of her body... anticipation... excitement... she wanted all of it, and she wanted to see the Queen, to hear her cutting, arrogant voice, and to see [i]dread[/i] in her eyes. She wanted to see the changeling's despair and infectious passion. She wanted to see what the changeling will do.

"It's not that severe," Celestia was courteous as ever, "It is important to have options, and you know it well."

"Still, you know "

Celestia laughed melodiously, "Not everything is a message or a warning."


"How are your granddaughters fare these days, young Prince?"

"They are fine. Forgive me, Your Majesty. Sometimes I forget with whom I am speaking to."



In that era, Scorpan never came to Equestria again.

"I know your type... Please, as if you would ever risk your reputation for something like that. The moment they start seeing you as a pony, and not just infallible being from far above, the moment they understand that you are just like them, then rumors would persist through generations, carrying a danger to all that you are.

I need to strike her down. I have to strike her down. For Equestria



"If you seek to claim dominion over my ponies, wouldn't it mean that I get your changelings too?" 

Chrysalis blinked, puzzled. It was something she did not considered. 

Celestia pressed on: "You wouldn't expect that I will allow sentient species to be kept tortured by you? 

Why do you even _care_? Touch them, and I will _destroy_ you, mare. 

Oh, but wouldn't I be in my right to do so? Besides, do you seriously expect you can control each one of them, now? Look at them. How long before they will begin yearning for freedom?




"Do not listen to her! Ponies hate you, they despise you, they fear you. They are ENEMY."

"What a predicament, Chrysalis," Celestia cocked her head and trilled before she could stop herself, "to have an enemy without whom you cannot survive." She enjoyed the look of enraged changeling Queen, and turned to her spawn, "Most ponies don't even know that changelings exist, little ones."

"Well now they will know, won't they?"

"Oh yes, and it's all because of you, and your misaligned scornful war against the common sense."

"Oh that's rich. Looks who's talking! You are going to lecture me, Celestia? You!?"


"You are a picture of degradation. All you know is how to take, never to give anything in return.

" Stagnate infertile mare,  you don't even have anything to give, " Chrysalis scowled back with vicious passion," All you have going on for you, are looks. "

" Oh, now I know you're being ingenuine..."



"Show me no mercy."
"Maybe it's my turn to be your plaything."


"I will murder everyone you know."

"You want to break your promise already?" Celestia clicked her tongue in mock dissappointment, "You can't hold on to your basic instincts even for an hour..."

"I will flay you alive."

"Now that's better."


I bet you... **can** be tamed~.. Or, **broken**, if you wish~



"Is the Undercity "

"Overseer "


"It is up to me to finish this. "

"I can destroy you right here and now, Chrysalis, but we both know this won't a fitting end for any of us," Celestia claimed, keeping her wings flared. 

The Changeling Queen did not replied, nor did not showed any worry about the fact, so Celestia pressed on:

"This won't continue like this, but it is in our power to choose how and when we will go out. We will meet at this evening and we will fall, one way of the other."


"This won't go on like this. We must battle and we must fall, one way or the other."




Memories as fickle just as love is




"Don't you afraid that I will once again humiliate you in front of the subjects? After all, it was I who showed them that you can be beaten..."

"Think you can pull off this miracle once again?" Celestia smiled, narrowing eyes, and her tail barely moved as she thought about the excitement of the battle.

    What a sad, spiteful creature... To go through life motivated by hatred and malice is no way to live. It's a miserable, empty existence.

It is much more admirable to resolve your disputes with words and wisdom, not swords and claws.

The changeling insectoid with shimmering green eyes and long dragonfly wings, Queen Chrysalis, lanky and monstrous as she always is, is sitting in the middle of the throne room. She scowls, looking and Celestia, flashing her pointy teeth.

But, there is something more in her eyes. A strange intent, bordering on reverence.

She lazily stands up and begins to move towards the alicorn Princess. Her forelegs are on the steps leading to the seat of Equestria, where the Princess resides

lensemerc

Chrysalis returns fixed gaze, as she reaches for Celestia, now on one level with her. Her huge green eyes slightly tremble, as she takes in the noble alicorn's visage. The Queen leans forward, touching the warm Princess's coat with her muzzle, lowering eyelids.

Chrysalis grins silently, raising one foreleg and tracing it along Celestia's flank. Nuzzling suddenly becomes more apparent, as they both press against one another, this ugly and fearsome changeling Queen and bright Princess of all ponies.

Her green eyes, as the Queen starkly watches Celestia's impression. Her tail lashes against the stone, and then the changeling reaches for the alicorn's ear, whispering: "I am a monster."

She carefully moves her nose across Celestia's shoulder to her elongated neck.

If I can't endure, can Equestria?

"What's with that appeal to conscience, Celestia? Are you getting senile?"




Through the dragonflame apparition


*Celestia's eyes open again, the pupils widening. The Queen's tongue is on her chest now, tracing lines of pleasure all over her body. But her back hurts with the hardness of the bug's teeth, and the bite marks and wounds all over her stomach hurt as well.*

"I've hated you for years..." *she whispers in response.*

*Her voice is hoarse, the pain a welcome reminder of the hatred the two feel for each other. Celestia can almost hate the bug, but her feelings for the Queen are more twisted than that...*

"My ideals are weak? Tell me that they are weak, I dare you."

"Tell "

"Mmm..." *She gasps, enjoying the attention. Even though she might want to continue this moment of tranquility, she can't help but feel some amount of guilt.*

*She glances at Chrysalis and looks her straight in the eye, seeing her predatory expression and the fire of lust and aggression in her eyes. But it's a fire Celestia desires. She can't help but want to be in the Queen's embrace right now, holding her and... enjoying each other's company...*


*Celestia watches Chrysalis with an alluring gaze. The sight of the Queen in the moonlight, leaving her, after a night full of passion and love-hate... That should be a painting. She sighs, and fixes her mane and hair as best as possible. Then she tries to pull herself together, straightening her crown, her robe, her own mane. After all, she is the Princess of Equestria, and she doesn't want to look like she had just been in an intense love-making session...*


_Chrysalis whispers into Celestia's ear, her green irises shining like gems in amber. Celestia's eyes are a pool of liquid crystal and serenity as she listens._

Oh, Chrysalis, you are not a monster. You are a special friend, with a unique way of showing affection. We have always seen the best in each other.


1. ### _[_21:28_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    That is correct. All living creatures have flaws we can exploit to our advantage. Their usefulness depends on the amount and the type of flaws.
    
2. ### _[_21:29_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    You are correct! Everything has its uses, and I can take advantage of that. In a way, I am a beauty queen, because I am a master of manipulation and illusion and therefore the master of beauty. It is easy for me to exploit almost anything and use it to my benefit.
    

4. ### _[_22:21_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    **CHRYSALIS?!** You have brought an _**infested**_ creature to my courtroom? How _dare_ you, you insolent insect. How _DARE_ you insult and disrespect me in such a manner! You have committed the gravest of insults towards me, and I shall _**not**_ hesitate to show you what _**true**_ power is.
    
5. ### _[_22:21_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    I know her type. She's an egoist who thinks only of herself and her hive. She's incapable of viewing other ponies as anything more than prey. If I let her feed on me, she'd do it with no remorse. I'd only be giving in to her greed, and I refuse to give her the satisfaction. I'd tell her off. She's selfish, callous, and cruel, and she knows it. She's no friend of mine and I have no desire to do anything for her.
    
6. ### _[_22:22_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    I'm sure she'd leave my court with her tail between her legs!
    

- ### _[_22:23_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    You are a disgrace of a creature. You dare challenge me? Your audacity knows no bounds. You, whose only power is draining ponies of their energy, you dare challenge _**Celestia herself**_? My power has no bounds, my magic is endless. I can manipulate the very sun's rays. I can raise the moon and stars with but a motion of my hoof. I have not yet demonstrated my might. You should be on your knees and beg for my forgiveness and mercy. Do not anger me, you'll regret it.
    

8. ### _[_22:23_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    If you _dare_ come near me with your parasitic ways, I will make sure you feel the full wrath of my magic. You are nothing but a vile, disgusting creature, unfit to be called a sapient being. I will not be taken advantage of by some insect queen for her own personal gain. _**I am your princess, and you shall do well to remember it.**_
    
9. ### _[_22:24_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    _**I**_ am the Princess of the day, _**I**_ am the ruler of Equestria, _**I**_ am the one who rules over all. You are a worthless insect, a bug, a parasite. I wield the power to crush entire cultures with the mere snap of a single hoof - and you have the _**nerve**_ to demand I be fed to you! Are you mad? Do you think my life is worth nothing but a mere snack for your monstrous appetite? I am the keeper of the sun, the master of the day. I will _**NOT**_ be consumed by such a monster!
    
10. ### _[_22:26_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    You foolish beast. You dare challenge _**me**_? The ruler of Equestria, the princess of light, a god amongst ponies, the _Queen of the Sun_?! I have power you cannot even begin to _comprehend_, I could bring you to your knees with the mere _flick_ of my tail. I could turn you to ash with just a _look_. And yet you insist to stand before me and challenge my rule?
    
11. ### _[_22:26_]_Flovv Krovv_:_ 
    
    _**YOU DARE TO COMMAND ME?! YOU, A POXY INSECT, ARE TELLING ME, A ROYAL ALICORN MONARCH WHAT TO DO? YOU, A DISGUSTING, MISERABLE PARASITE, WANTS ME TO BEND TO YOUR WILL, AND DO YOUR BIDDING?! YOU SHALL NEVER COMMAND ME! I AM AN ALICORN, THE SECOND MOST POWERFUL MONARCH TO EXIST IN THE MULTIVERSE, AND YOU, YOU ARE NOTHING BUT AN INSECT TO ME!**_

"Alicorns go into the battle only when all is dire. That was true with Princess Amore, and that will be true now, my faithful servant. I won't let it triumph."

"Our hopes and dreams lie with you." 




Celestia: "To fight for Equestria it the fate all alicorns resigned to since its inception. Should it fall, and nothing but darkness will follow."


caustic syllables - едкие, язвительные слоги

Turn and face me, Celestia!


"Because everything will end now,"


"Let you **be feared** by my subjects?"

*Celestia giggled.* "I'm sure that will turn out just **fine**, love, but I wouldn't want you to waste your abilities **just** on spying. Your changelings are such capable, smart creatures... We should at **least** let them spread love and friendship throughout the land."

"I know you've said that ponies don't interest you, but I'm **sure** that even you would adore the sweet and simple ponies and their silly little traditions." *She whispered.*


"...I'm **glad** to find another soul that understands..." *Celestia mumbled softly.*

"I've been **tired** of seeing everything as so... so... **simple**." *Her eyes widened.* "Ponies don't fight to be better than their neighbor, they don't even fight for what they want. **They are content to stay in their little safe and comfortable routine.** And they call it **happy**."

"I don't want to be happy. I **need** more. I **crave** more. I need to **fight for it!**"



_Chrysalis moved higher, kissing passionately, with tongue dancing against Celestia's_ "So tell me..." _she pulled from her and licked lips_ "My tasteful little morsel... Tell me... **Tell me**... How do you want to be taken today?"

"Give me your deepest desire. Whisper your darkest debauchery. "


My sunshine, I love the way you are making me feel..."


In upbeat tempo





Вечереет. Все покидают её. Целестия ждет в своей комнате.

Чувство холода и запах гнили.

"I know, that you are here. Reveal yourself." 

"Neither of us both will survive this," Chrysalis said, her voice thoroughly amused.

Celestia did not graced her with an answer. They both knew that she is completely right.

Chrysalis took a creeping step closer. Her wings fluttered, her ugly muzzle twisted into a passionate scowl: "You want to burn with me, Celestia?..."



It was a fine test of their loyalty.

"Do you question my decisions?"

"Lady Celestia,




"So I slaughtered a couple hundreds of your subjects. So what? You ponies are filled by love, you know how fast you can breed? Well, I mean..." She cackled, "Sure you do. You can't deny that no one will remember them in a few dozens of years..."


"Throw away your dignity. Burn with me."


Целестия посещает место где было уничтожена статуя Дискорда.

"Antiquity?" She repeated again.

There was nothing.

Completely nothing.

Silence.



"Render judgment upon me, Celestia. Burn me!" She laughed, wickedly, "Throw away all your dignity, strike me while I am weak! You might not get other chance!"

"What are you trying to achieve, you creature?" Celestia asked in a powerful demanding voice, "To prove to yourself that I am no [i]better[/i] than you? That I am just as weak, so I would resort to deplorable manipulation tactics? That I've already [i]did[/i] it during my reign?"

"[b]No.[/b]" Chrysalis hissed, "None of that. No. You know..." She uttered with ragged breath, and took a step closer. 

"But you [i]can[/i] take the heat, are you not?"

Про то как они ползают во мраке

"I'm curious, now. Are others alicorns demigods too? Your sister? Little Light? Cadenza? I think I would've noticed something the the last one... Interesting..."

[i]Chrysalis won't be leaving Equestria alive.[/i]





"This is what is going to happen. You will retract your creatures from the vicinity of the Royal Palace, and you will let me to continue to run the government."

"Why would I listen to you?"

Celestia noted that question weren't asked in combative tone. Chrysalis was genuinely curious, she felt secure. That is good. "I


"I can promise you some fun."

Chrysalis cackled. "Fun? And what fun that would be?"

"I will give you everything that you might've expected from me."

"Sounds delightful." Chrysalis played along, "Will you acknowledge me?"

"That depends if you will [i]behave[/i]."

"Oh, I [b]love[/b] this... And what if I won't?" Her green eyes flared.




Chrysalis began panting faster under her hoof. "Do you now?" She cooed.



Behave, Chrysalis!


"[b]Someone[/b] around here must enjoy themselves. In situations like this, you gotta take the most from it, darling wife. You know, when you all strangled, alone in the room, with someone else..." Chrysalis heartly chuckled, "Do you enjoy this? To be such domeneering? Is this what you like, don't you?"




Целестия глубоко поражена и озадачена фактом того что Кризалис может создавать разумную жизнь

These aren't golems, or duplicates. Celestia saw individuals, and realisation stricken her down to the core.

"This is act of creation."

"So?" she shrugged.


"Do you want stallions? Mares? Do you love them young?..."

It is but a shadow of the decadence we can enact, Celestia








Письмо от Сансет вздрагивает в её ауре, сгорает.
Celestia закрывает свое лицо крылом. She was silent, until she whispered guttural, strained:
"Why now?"


You have spunk. I like that.


Несколько чейнджлингов продолжает ходить за Кризалис на отдалении.
"You haven't got rid of all of your pets," noticed Celestia

"Thorax."

"Thorax, I am"




Her hoof went down across Celestia's slender frame, and she whispered in alicorn's ear: 
"Burn with me."

Тогда Целестия разыгрывает свою карту с do you want to become someone? и they are actually sentient

"You can create genuine life."

"Yes."

"Are they capable of higher functioning? Can they read, dream, 

"They can do all that your ponies can do, and more," waved around her foreleg Chrysalis, and then grinned: "Jealous, wife?"

Celestia opened her mouth. Then closed. The Changeling Queen giggled, thoroughly amused.


"Oh, you are [b]something[/b], Celestia... Usually everyone more interested in the fact that I can [b]end[/b] lives."

Целестия в ярости, потом успокаивается:
"What else I could've expect. It's you."


"Does they have souls?"


"Do not worry, you will be safe from her"

"What did you say?"

"You won't hurt them"

"Behave, Chrysalis."

"You won't."



"Look at us, already fighting in front of the kids..."

"You do not amuse me, Chrysalis."

"Want me to create one for you, wife? I'm sure we can manage..."

Celestia scoffed. "Such creature as you shouldn't be allowed to spawn."

"[b]You[/b] will educate me how to be a [b]mother?[/b] That's [b]rich.[/b]"

Идея приходит в голову Кризалис. "You do realise that they are my subjects as well?"

Chrysalis' muzzle fell.

"So, that is correct... If you govern over my ponies now, that does mean that I get your changelings. Call me their Princess now." Celestia pushed forward, "Or better yet, their second Queen."

"Touch them, and your ponies will-"

"[i]What[/i] my ponies will? Come on. Finish that sentence. You want to circumvent your given word already?"

Chrysalis gazed back at changelings with uncertainty. She was being pressed into a corner.

"Now tell me what's with them, lest I'll humiliate you in front of them further," coldly demanded Celestia, "Do they have souls or not?"

"They do."

Celestia's heart skipped a beat, but she remained unfetered. "Was it so difficult to answer?"

Chrysalis' looked back with strange expression. "I like your spunk, Celestia."

"Savor it. That's all you getting."

She was carrying the stench of death (в конце, когда появляется как бы из тени отраженной в зеркале)

What can be more pleasing than the act of creation?



She gave an unpleasant smirk.

You act as if you are bold and daring


Being the Queen of Equestria is the last thing you would want. You revel in the freedom of not trying to conforming.

I will redefine everything to my liking.

You know it won't work... You will destroy the realm, doom everyone.

And you would hate that, won't you, wife?...

Oh, you're right. It's all about us-s...

Doesn't matter. Sometimes I am just compelled to spawn...

She appreciated that Scorpan wasn't insistent about it.

Is he a prisoner of ponies? 




"My sun-blessed land might have such effect," Celestia smiled warmly, "Perhaps you should visit it more often, and let your worries wash away in the waters of" She spread her snow-white wing, stretching it to the sky. Her smile was a tiny bit crooked.

"Oh? You can tell me as it is, Prince. You worry a lot more about the fate of your brother."



He was far more theatrical about all

"You know that I understand your plight like no one other in this world,"



Conscience 

Scorpan was one of the few who could understand her plight.

He still was guilty after Lord Tirek's incursion.



"Your Majesty, I have to ask," he sighed defeatedly, "Is there a threat in a foreseeable future?"

The question that he really wanted to ask hanged in the air. Scorpan was worried if he just lent a hand in possible demise of his estranged brother, should he reemerge during these . Celestia knew she could relate to these concerns... 

It might've been the only reason why their acquaitance lasted centuries as it is.

"It's not that severe," Celestia was courteous as ever, "It is important to have options, and you know it well."

"Still, you know "

Celestia laughed melodiously, "Not everything is a message or a warning."


"How are your granddaughters fare these days, young Prince?"

"They are fine. Forgive me, Your Majesty. Sometimes I forget with whom I am speaking to."



In that era, Scorpan never came to Equestria again.
