[The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/The_Lost_Treasure_of_Griffonstone "The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone") introduces the griffons' home kingdom of [Griffonstone](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Griffonstone "Griffonstone"). The griffons here are depicted as a greedy race whose lust for gold and treasure is stated to rival that of [dragons](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Dragons "Dragons"), and they only offer their services in exchange for [bits](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Bits "Bits"). In ancient times, their ruler [King Grover](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_non-pony_characters#King_Grover "List of non-pony characters") ushered in an era of prosperity for the griffons with the golden Idol of Boreas, which became the city's centerpiece. According to [Grampa Gruff](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Grampa_Gruff "Grampa Gruff"), however, the griffons returned to their selfish old ways during the rule of [King Guto](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_non-pony_characters#King_Guto "List of non-pony characters") when the idol was stolen by the monster [Arimaspi](https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_non-pony_characters#Arimaspi "List of non-pony characters"), both of which plummeted into the Abysmal Abyss nearby, leaving the once glorious city in shambles.
