The city features numerous ivory towers with golden spires and many waterfalls and rivers running through it.

Canterlot had an unusual geometry to it, which could remind the layers of a growing tree or a sort of fungi slapped on the side of a rock. If historical records were correct, massive circular platforms that supported the whole structure of a city could expand per the whim of a ruling Princess. Twilight always craved a chance to look into the magic behind this unique phenomenon, but in each attempt at the inquiry, Celestia answered, wearing the usual hard-to-read smile: "_When the time comes, Little Light_."
