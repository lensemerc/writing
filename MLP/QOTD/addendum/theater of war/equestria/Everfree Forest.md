- Warmth of the Stars

--- Castle of the Two Sisters (Everfree Settlement)

[Warmth of the Stars]

'Here she is, in the throne room. Celestia stopped in her tracks, panting after the recent battle. Her mind was riled with conflict... <...> ...for night ponies were trampling down the streets of the small settlement of Everfree, and Lunar Princess stepped in herself, prepared for the final confrontation... <...>  ...as she proceeded to climb up the tribune that they used to address the subjects. A symbol meant to represent their equal status as alicorns... <...> ...Luna's hooves smashed down, destroying the front of the platform she was on. A flurry of cracks appeared on a wall behind her, resembling a growing tree, and then the wall broke down. The sky was showing... <...> ...Their chase above Castle of the Two Sisters was short-lived. More magic of black and teal color filled the space all around Celestia, as she kept on flying and dodging, completely at a loss of what to do.'
