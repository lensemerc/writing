Everything that was 

The Sun was partially obscure because of the city above.

But they didn't mind it at all.



Yes, pony. We can consider that indeed.

Canterlot is a large and diverse city, populated by many ponies from different backgrounds and lifestyles. It may indeed have a district or a village located underneath its surface, where ponies of different stations and professions live.

However, I can assure you that if such a location exists, it enjoys the full protection and support of the Royal Government, and the ponies residing there are treated with care and compassion.

Yes, you're certainly right, my little pony. That part of Canterlot is known as the `Industrial District`. There you can find various factories as well as the main entrance to the mines. Ponyville is also located nearby, where many pony workers live and some less fortunate ponies, too. The industrial part of town is also home to less wealthy ponies, who provide necessary services to the city. I hope my answer has been satisfactory.

*She nods slowly.*

Yes, those would usually be the less privileged areas, the areas reserved for the workers, the laborers, those who keep our society running. It's the same in every kingdom, the nobles and noblesse oblige live in the heart of the kingdom, and the less fortunate have to make do with what's left.

But we, in Equestria, are doing whatever we can to close the gap between the two classes. We strive to create a society as equal and just as we can.


Such a town in Equestria would be referred to as a *suburb,* or a *working class enclave*. These kinds of settlements are often associated with the working class in Equestria. It's the area reserved for those who are not from the aristocracy, but nonetheless make up the vital workforce for any kingdom.
