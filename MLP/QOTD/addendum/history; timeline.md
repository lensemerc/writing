Луна и Солнце в рогах огромного оленя

1. ### 22:28_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    hmm. Well, there can be always two sets of the Elements, one used by Celestia and Luna and that she later lost connection with, and then the one that was created for Mane 6

    hmm. Well, there can be always two sets of the Elements, one used by Celestia and Luna and that she later lost connection with, and then the one that was created for Mane 6
    
    ### _[_22:29_]_Bean (pondering arc)_:_ 
    
    Basically, yeah. The Princesses' elements are the stone orbs the ponies find in the castle of two sisters, in S01E02 - which NMM shatters. The mane six elements are _basically_ like reincarnation.
    
3. ### _[_22:31_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    Yeah, she _shatters_ them, good catch. there's some wiggle room around, like the tree with their cutie marks allows them to be remade there and then
1. ### _[_22:33_]_Bean (pondering arc)_:_ 
    
    I think the tree allows for the re-manifestation of the elements. The ones the princesses have don't seem to be tied to the paragons of those elements, after all - those are more like tools that were found and used.
    
2. ### _[_22:33_]_Bean (pondering arc)_:_ 
    
    So the mane six elements are more like "the essence of the elements" manifested again.
    
3. ### _[_22:34_]_Bean (pondering arc)_:_ 
    
    And the old elements are a pair of impudent godlings using an artifact they did not really understand.
    
4. ### _[_22:34_]_Bean (pondering arc)_:_ 
    
    Or really, know how to use properly.
    
5. ### _[_22:34_]_Bean (pondering arc)_:_ 
    
    They can only use it to turn others to stone, after all.
    
6. ### _[_22:35_]_Bean (pondering arc)_:_ 
    
    Twilight uses the elements to _purify_ evil.
    
7. ### _[_22:35_]_Bean (pondering arc)_:_ 
    
    In that sense, the S9 ending is a regression, I guess.
    
8. ### _[_22:37_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    Yeah, that's interesting. I tied turning Discord into the stone partially because it is a direct application of harmonical power to the spirit of disharmony. It's his antithesis. It seems perfectly logical for him to freeze in place
    
9. ### _[_22:37_]_Farcalor (arching the dark arc)_:_ 
    
    After all, Mane 6 done the same thing to him
    
10. ### _[_22:37_]_Bean (pondering arc)_:_ 
    
    Yeah, that does make sense.
