The forgotten old place was abandoned for years.

[center][i]"I will wear your face~...-[/i][/center]

She was being dragged across the stone floor by the leg. Completely undignified. Beaten.

[i][center]-...they will not even notice you're gone~...-[/center][/i]

On fangs of the creature was her blood. She was drained, [i]used[/i]. She couldn't muster a single spell.

[i][center]-...your groom will love me, not you~...-[/center][/i]

Her doppleganger looked at her, a distorted reflection. Its happy singing voice sounded like her own.

[center][i]-...and when I deal with them, I'll come back for [b]seconds.[/b][/i]"[/center]

"Someone will save me... Someone will..." She trembled in darkness and cold for what felt like for eons, being afraid for herself and for others. 

Then Twilight suddenly came, and being deceived by the creature, she almost blasted Cadance on sight. Twilight was so on edge, that Cadance managed to prove who she is only through their silly old dance. 

And everything was resolved. Her worst day became one of her best. It was an adventure, and they prevailed.

But scars remained.

[hr]

She needed a few minutes to recollect herself.

She thought about love and fear. 

How deeply they intertwined...

Two emotions couldn't be more different, and yet they moved hoof in hoof. In many regards, love was about managing fear, as where fear reigned, love diminished. 

Just like love, fear came in innumerable forms. It could be fear of expectations, of relations, of loss, of trust, of [i]vulnerability[/i]... And yet, despite all the ways to perceive it, love was always worth conquering fear. Always.

Long ago Cadance had proven her worth by standing against someone who succumbed to fear. 'Prismia' she was called, the old and pitiful hag that lived alone at the outskirts of Cadance's hometown. Disillusioned by the world, submerged into loneliness and despair, she tried to do the unthinkable, and leech all love from ponies for her own sake. Cadance, just a little pegasus back then, was the only one who was able to stop her.

Both of their lives changed dramatically since then, and constant fight against the fear became more complicated, gained a new dimension and purpose... As Cadance undestood her responsibilities better, she mastered the mask that was required of her. Aunt Celestia helped her. For years Cadance expected to shoulder hopes and dreams of the world, but then the other alicorns began to appear and reemerge, and Cadance happily took a step to sidelines.

After all was said and done, she got a chance to live her own life, even to be the Princess in charge of her own kingdom. Cadance was supposed to feel blessed, as she was surrounded by loved ones, graced by having a family... Why then she always felt this unease deep inside? She couldn't describe the feeling properly, even in her most calm and intimate thoughts. Was it just paranoia? Some unresolved ambition? 

Why she never truly happy? Is it normal to constantly not feel satisfied?

But whatever was the reason for it, now wasn't the time to mull over her feelings. All her thoughts were invariably circling back to the Princess of the Sun, to her ever looming warm presence, known since foalhood. Celestia was supposed to be at the Royal Palace right now, trapped with that parasite... Cadance just couldn't stop worrying about it, and any distraction from it, as well as from the ongoing terror, couldn't suffice.

"Your Highness?" the voice called to her, and she snapped out of it.

"Here. I'm here. Everything's fine?" She opened eyes, raised head with a shimmering horn. Short respite had passed.

"More or less," the speaker on the other side of the door replied in shaken tone, and Cadance stood up from her resting place. She felt a short dizzyness, then wiped few leftover tears from her muzzle, hoping that eyes aren't too red. She took a deep breath.

Love will prevail. 

She stepped out of the door, and nurse Cheery Hooves, one of the senior staff members, awkwardly shuffled out of her way. Mare carried a frozen, mortified look on her muzzle that lit up with hope at Cadance's sight. In the last few hours the Princess came to recognize it well. Each time it reminded her of the day when Crystal Ponies were liberated, and it wasn't a good memory.

"So far we managed to find rooms for all severely hurt patients, but there isn't enough supplies and doctors to accomodate," Cheery talked in brisk pace, as she trotted along fast moving alicorn, "There's are also some, ah... agitation. Noble ponies are angered that we forced to give them same treatment as the rest..."

"Of [i]course[/i] they are," Cadance uttered under breath. She always was amazed by how strongly the priveleged folk could stick to their customs. Sometimes she considered her humble upbringing as a blessing in disguise—it was giving her [i]perspective[/i]. 

"Your Highness, can you help calm them down?" weakly asked Cheery, "They get in the way of our work."

Right, she is [i]the[/i] peacemaker. Cadance entertained the thought of foalsitting those sinecures, and realized that the just doesn't have the energy for it. She belonged at the edge of the magical barrier that was erected by her around the hospital, not in the safety of the walls, easing the worries of those who won't appreciate it.

Her gaze wandered over the ponies that were in the hallway. They were of all trades, every tribe, every standing. Stallions and mares, colts and fillies, most of them unharmed, but all stricken with terror and uncertainty. Murmur went on between them, but in general they were silent and waiting. Their gazes clang to Cadance, each one equally hungry for miracle. 

The Princess remained composed. It's just like another stroll before subjects. After all, ponies always need something. 

There were at least a few hundred of them in the Canterlot Hospital now, and while it was only large medical institution in the capital and was build to accomodate, it began to feel crowded nonetheless. Canterlot never was a big populated city, but still, there were thousands of ponies, currently unaccounted for... 

Influx of new stragglers was constant, and the changelings, that spreaded over city like an infection, perfectly knew about it. They all were drawn to pink shield that was erected by Cadance. She felt how dark creatures were trying to chip away at it somewhere, it was a steady feel, torturous, always on back of her mind. It all needed to be end soon.

As she kept silence and tried to find excuse not to go, a familiar figure appeared in far end of the corridor, and Cadance felt relieved. Some normalcy...

"Maybe I'll start with this one, and then work my way from there," she grinned to Cheery Hooves, and stepped to meet her favorite hatesink.

"Cadance!" Prince Blueblood bellowed, groggily shambling toward her. His mane was a mess and scorch mark on his chest was glaring, but the stallion still carried himself with all the stubborness of a highborn mule.

"[i]Heck, maybe he really has some of alicorn blood in him,[/i]" Cadance wondered, eyeing that scorch. She was hoping that Blueblood would be knocked out for longer. "Ah, if it isn't you, good Prince Vladimir. What a sight for sore eyes. How do you fare? Does the night treat you well?"

"Cadance, I was informed that my royal [i]Adjudicator[/i] is in your posession," Blueblood pointed his hoof almost threatingly, "I demand you to relinquish it to me at once!"

"The [i]what[/i] now?" Cadance cocked her head, trying to withheld laughter, then looked under her wing, "Oh, you mean the sword! I'll keep it for now. Maybe you should be more aware of where you trying to stick it, dear brother," her smile was disarmingly innocent.

He pouted. As far as Cadance was concerned, Celestia treated her alleged blood relation to the Bluebloods as some sort of long-standing joke, but there was a serious undertone to it as well. In the unlikely scenario that alicorns wouldn't be able to respond to their duties, the Blueblood family had the right to rise as a line of regents. Equestria would be doomed anyway, but at least the wreckage that would occur would be a guided one, so their charred remains might end up lying in a pleasing manner, so to speak.

"[i]Happy thoughts, Cadenza. Ponies need you. They look up to you.[/i]"

"I know, we have this rivalry going on between us," Blueblood pleaded, trying to be genuine for a change, "but dear Father will positively murder me if he knows that I lost our heirloom, surely you understand?"

"Pish posh, don't worry your pretty head. It's not like I am taking your pride, or anything. Good weaponry is sparse, as well as able-bodied ponies who can wield it. I'll settle the matter with old Vsevolod," Cadance chittered frivolously, walking to the main hall.

"Sister, you're [i]slaying[/i] me out here. You literally slaying me," he whinnied quietly, still hoping to play out the pity card, as if it ever worked with her, "I need it to protect myself... and others. What if those changelings happen to be upon us? What then? I'll be cursing you with my dying breath while they do with me Celestia-knows-what, that's what!"

"I'm sorry, Vlad," Cadance cringed, but placed a hoof on his shoulder, forcing herself to talk reassuringly, "Recuperate. Equestria needs you to be strong. If we're lucky, I'll kill few little beasts myself until the night's end, in the name of our shared family. You can take all the credit if you want. We can say that you supplied me with Abjucator when you were felled in glorious duel against the Queen of the Changelings herself. It's almost true! Just think of all the attention!"

"No, you won't get rid of me that easily," he frowned like a defiant child, still following. 

"Dear brother, you need to rest!" She nickered, but not tried to restrain him, "You know, not all stories happen on the front lines, anyway. Let some mare take care of you and your, er, battle scar!"

She tried to glance at Cheery Hooves, but the nurse were already spirited away by more pressing troubles. Blueblood shook his head: "I'd rather burn in Tartarus than keep lying down for another minute. That Chrysalis creature dishonored me, and I will take what's rightfully due."

Cadance raised a brow. So Vladimir have redeeming qualities? Food for thought.

At the main hall something had stolen her attention. Before her was occurring a small scene: two members of the Royal Guard were on patrol, and one of them, a unicorn, stood over a pair of ponies huddled at the wall. Regular checkup, it seemed. All of them looked beaten.

One of two ponies, a mare, was glaring at the armor-clad ponies. Her pretty muzzle was twisted in contemptious grimace. She batted away spear of one of the guard, then made a beeline to the nearest window.

"A changeling!" rang a shout from somewhere. Blueblood froze on the spot, Cadance half-drawn her sword, but everything was already over. The creature were already pinned down by speartips, and was rapidly reverting to its original form. The beast wriggled and hissed, as the guards tore their weapons out from its body only to bring them down again.  

Cadance did not look at it, though. She watched as a stallion, a companion to deceiving creature, crawled on his knees toward its expiring form. His hoof was outstretched and pressed down, his muzzle, obscured by the hair, seemed grief-stricken. Strangely, this image stole all Cadance's attention. "[i]What is this?[/i]" she thought, "[i]What feeling is this? An empathy? Is this love, too? Does it matter if it is misaligned, if it's real?[/i]"

"Cadance. Hey. You with me?"

A voice of her husband returned Cadance back to reality. His concerned icy-blue eyes were right before her. She exhaled shakily, nuzzled into him shortly, pulling her mind away from the scene. Not the time to lose focus.

"Your Highness, aren't you supposed to be under guard?" Shining Armor smirked flirtatiously, and it helped her regain her bearings.

"Yeah. [i]My[/i] guard was away, though," she quietly giggled in response, walking through the front door. She was never the one to be held down by the rules.

Blueblood was lagging behind them, unperturbed by any of what happened. The sight of his blissfully smug expression gave some leeway to Cadance... maybe she just imagined it all.

She surveyed the situation outside: everything still was the same. 

She saw scurrying dark shadows beyond the wall of her magic, between uneven droplets of water, sparkling in the light. The Hive was like a wriggling mess of insects sometimes. They always looked busy with something, agitated by the ongoing hunt. Encircling, waiting for something to happen. 

Right before the wall, Stygian was hunched over the one of dead changelings, while surrounded by number of guards. Two of Cadance's personal royal guard were among others, acknowledging her with curt nods as she and stallions joined the commotion. During recent disasterous wedding, she allowed these crystal ponies to go partake in the city-wide celebration, and haven't come to regret this decision since they quickly found her in ensuing chaos.

"If we are going at war with those creatures," Stygian was collected and serious, as he was holding up a speech, "we should at least understand how to fight them in close combat. Look here. Their insides aren't that different from ours, so if you hadn't skipped your basic anatomy lessons, you should know where to strike to hurt the most."

"But what about their chitin?" Ivory Rook, one of her guards, spoke up. He, Beam Flitter, and Stygian, immediately shared some semblance of camaraderie, that was known only to those who lived through the events that occured one thousand years ago. 

Cadance hadn't pried into it. She hadn't got a chance yet. 

"Aye, they have something that can be called chitin," instructed grim unicorn, operating with a short sword as a pointer, "As you can see, it protects their spine, shoulders, and chest. Their hooves seem to be completely made of this hard substance," Stygian lifted the limb in question, not yet stiffened by rigor mortis, "Maybe something related to their transformation magic, but I guess we will leave the final word to real experts. Just hit them like you would want to hit a pony with intent to kill:-"

Some of the members of the Royal Guard were pale, already showing signs of anxiety. Shining Armor, Ivory Rook, and Beam Fitter, remained composed and attentive. Vladimir finally stepped aside, not willing to participate in it.

"-neck, inner thigh, groin area, underarm, stomach—by the looks of it they have blood circulation system very similar to ours," Stygian spoke impassionate, and this reminded Cadance of Twilight, specifically when she [i]really[/i] gets into topic that interests her and dissociates with reality completely, "One good cut or puncture, and they can just bleed out with whatever they have instead of blood... Some fluid plasma of unique sort?... Can't be sure. What could be troubling for us the most, is this—"

His hooves moved into the opened section of a changeling's torso. Cadance noted the lack of use of telekinetic magic. Stygian scooped up and pulled dark glistening entrails of perished creature, his scrunched muzzle showing barely a hint of displeasure.

"Oh, I can't watch..." Cadance murmured. But she kept watching anyway.

"See this?" Stygian looked at them starkly, "It is a digestive system, atrophied because of lack of intended use, but in theory perfectly functionable nonetheless. They have a complete set of organs, you can see it for yourselves if you wish. Ergo, we can posit that, for all intents and purposes, they are like ponies but severely twisted by dark magic." Stygian finished his grim speech, and made a pause to let the thought settle in.

"What does that supposed to mean?" Shining asked with confusion, glancing at the living changelings, who didn't seemed to be thrilled by ongoing public autopsy, "What, they are mammals?"

"Are they vertebrates?" Cadance added, "They doesn't seem to be like insects at all."

"Well, see, that is where it is going to be most curious. Notice the lack of any sexual characteristics," Stygian replied, "You can also posit, for all intents and purposes, that they are also like [i]drones[/i]. Workers. They are..." He frowned, thinking, "Mimics, aye? They're simple... [i]Simplified[/i]... And yet, this creature before us is like an amalgamation of different ones, and this can tell us about their high capability to evolution... Or an ability to [i]adapt[/i]... Or maybe about a lack thereof, given the circumstances, and their seeming inability to reproduce..."

"So what does it lead to?" Beam Fitter asked, "What is the takeaway?"

"They can be studied and understood." Stygian peered at the creatures beyond the barrier, "They have emotions like us. They can be spoken to. They even show attributes of all three tribes, though it is debatable. And given that they have seemingly no culture of their own, we might even be able to coexist, in the future... If we think of them as [i]another type of pony[/i], that is."

"That is absurd!" Cadance spoke too loud than intended, and all looked at her, "You talk of those pillagers, parasites, that brought [i]war[/i] on our doorstep! And now you propose some sort of tolerance for their kind?" Cadance rose her head high, glaring daggers, her wings unfurled, "So what if they like us!? It doesn't excuse [i]any[/i] of their misdeeds!"

"Aye. I'm sorry, Your Highness," Stygian lowered his head, "I might've overstepped. Please, forgive me. The point of this presentation was to show how to fight them more effeciently, and that is all. For manners of similitude, I'd like also to point out their sensitivity to light. It should be easy to blind them with fire, lamps, or magic, for they are accustomed to see in darkness."

"Alright, enough of this. Thank you, Stygian," Shining smiled lopsidedly, placing foreleg on Cadance's shoulder. She finally got a chance to look at him closely, noting a strange device, strapped on a wrist of a hoof. They made a few steps, right were Blueblood was waiting, before her husband turned and looked with warm attention: "You're good?"

"Yeah," she rubbed forehead. Constant strain in the horn was taking its toll, but it was nothing compared to when she needed to protect Crystal Spire.

"How's Spike and the girls?" 

"Fluttershy became silent, even more than usual," Cadance frowned, "Dash still haven't came to, I've made sure that she is in the best care possible. Others are a great help around the hospital. They do not know what to think, it seems, about what had happened. I mean, about Twilight. We're all just waiting now, yes?"

"What is that you're carrying around, Shining?" Vladimir suddenly butted in, "Looks like a hindlegged magical artifact from Undercity. Are you aware these things are illicit?"

"Believe it or not, I've got it from a friend in the Royal Guard. The Arcane Ministry's tuition is finally paying off, Vlad?" Shining smiled lightheartedly.

"Father blessed me with personal tutorship," Blueblood shrugged.

Cadance arched her brow, examining the device. "Vlad raised a good point, for a change. Why do you even need this toy, love?"

"Oh, I'm going out there. After Twilight. Someone needs to bring her back."

"You think she will fail?" Cadance jerked her head up. Almost instinctively, her wing flared to prevent Blueblood from chipping in with his opinion. She saw how he already drew breath to say something ill-fitting.

"No-no," Shining smiled wearily, "It's just not okay with me, alright? I rarely get to act out like a big brother to her, so it's now or never. One hoof there, another here. I'll be safe; you won't even notice I'm gone."

Cadance slightly winced and tried to look for help at Stygian and members of the guard, but they just shamefully avoided eye contact, mostly. So they had already been talked into this...

"Shiny... Darling, please..." She placed a hoof on his. He sighed, but behind his eyes there was resolution, one that she loved and feared so much.

"Sorry, dove."

"I'm coming with," she said sternly.

"Yeah, no. We aren't leaving Flurry without parents."

"Take Ivory and Beam, then!"

"I'll be less noticeable when moving alone," he said, shaking his head. "Faster, too. Also, I know the city to its last nook and cranny, you know those 'lings will never get me."

"You don't—"

"Listen, love. We both know that I am your good-looking, reliable Prince-Consort, but not much beyond that, right?" He took her hoof into his, and gently caressed over it, "I am a figurehead. If the worst happens to me, Crystal Ponies will still have their Crystal Princess, and we still will have a fighting chance against Chryssie... I am disposable, alright? You however, are not. Cadance..." He looked concerned, lifting her hung head to keep their eyes on one level, "Don't go all sappy on me, alright? Don't cry. You know I can't leave, if you cry."

Cadance blinked fast and gulped. "You are a fool."

"Yeah."

"Just like Twilight."

"Yeah..." He sighed, pulled away, and looked towards the barrier. He wanted to go right now. It was [i]too[/i] soon.

"Twilight will manage," she said softly, just like to other Elements earlier. "She is a strong girl. She made her choice."

"Yeah. So am I. I'll just try to make [i]sure[/i] she manages."

"Why are you always making it all so complicated?" Cadance breathed out, despite her better judgment.

"Yeah, well..." he shrugged with that foolish smile of his, taking another step and covering his head with a hood, "This spot is safe. Whenever you're ready, love."

"You're completely not thinking about me. About us."

"M-hm."

Cadance made a long, exasperated groan, leaning forward and looking starkly at the muzzle of her husband. "You're absolutely despicable. Why did I marry such heartless bastard?"

"Because you love me."

"No, I hate you. Hate you. You hear? What I will even do without you... You are [i]not[/i] disposable! No one is!"

He laughed and looked back with happy amusement: "Glad to hear."

"Get Twilight and return alive, understand?"

"As you wish, Your Highness!" He gave out a cocky bow, turned, and vanished through the magical wall, which dispersed before him.

Cadance smiled through heartache, then remembered something and ran up to the barrier: "You have three hours! Three hours, you hear!? Or I'll come right after you myself!"

He nodded briskly, grinning, and then was gone without a trace somewhere in the constant rain. Cadance's heart was thumping fast as she stared with uncertainty, not knowing what she was supposed to feel. Pride? Powerlessness?

Well, only a few days ago she longed for some spice and drama, hasn't she?

[hr]

She was relentless. Waiting never felt so miserable before. Each passing minute was building upon previous one, slowly creeping over and adding to shared weight, and there was nothing but fear and anxiety now.

But Cadance was a strong pony, she was the alicorn and a Princess, and she was supposed to endure. For herself and for others.

She wanted a glass of wine, to tug herself under the warm blanket, and listen to how the wind howls beyond crystal walls of the Spire. She wanted that her biggest troubles would be worrying about Flurry's future, as well as governing over sleepy small kingdom in the far north. She wanted to see smiling friendly faces again.

But instead she looked on as a slow procession of ponies was treading through the mud and pools of water, all of them drenched and in need of warmth which she was incapable to fully provide. She isn't Celestia, or even the miracle worker. Not really.

The barrier dissipated before new noble ponies, and Cadance ordered Stygian calmly: "They're all in need of inspection. Call our unicorns, it's no time to rest. We must not let any of the beasts to slip through."

The one that was leading the procession caught her attention, stepping in front of her, and Cadance's heart happily fluttered at familiar sight. "Yes. Proceed with that," he said, and Cadance squealed in unprincess-like manner, pulling the older pony into a hug.

"Kibitz!" She giggled, "You're alright!"

"I [i]was[/i] alright until this moment," Kibitz sighed, and even his soaked moustache sagged down defeatedly, "I'd say, this calamity is what happens when you give majordomo of the Canterlot Castle a [i]few days off[/i], is it not?"

"Well, it wasn't [i]my[/i] decision," Cadance pouted, "You should blame everything on the Queen of the Changelings."

"That, I will do," he patted the alicorn's shoulder, being released, "Her invasion was glaringly unscheduled, after all."

"What news do you bring?" She looked over the procession, noting bleak and worn-out expressions. And one would think, this night was supposed to be a happy celebration...

"Nothing good, I am afraid. As you can see, we came here under Princess Celestia's direct order. There's only changelings with her in the Palace now, to my knowledge." Kibitz answered grimly.

Cadance nodded. Almost the whole staff of the Royal Palace was here, including all who was hosted there this day in any capacity—all in all, a sizable lot. She noticed more soldiers of the Royal Guard among the ponies, a welcoming sight. Their commander was captain Glimmering Shield, current second-in-command under Flash Magnus. That meant that Magnus himself was somewhere else in the city, still fighting for its freedom.

Just like others. All are fighting, except her. Cadance's jaw clenched.

"Kibitz?" Vladimir stepped somewhere out of her peripheral vision. His eyes were searching, "I must inquire, is my Father with you? Was he hurt?"

"Ah, Prince Blueblood..." Kibitz sighed, "My sincerest apologies. There's important information I must deliver to you, concerning your father." 

"Out with it!" Blueblood smiled nervously, as uncertain glances from other ponies began to get to him.

"I am not a correct pony to announce it, but... Your father, the Duke," Kibitz deadpanned, "was killed."

"Papa is killed? No..." Blueblood's face fell, "How?"

"We found him in one of the staff rooms. Changelings got to him there. He tried to fight, and..." Kibitz removed his glasses with shaken hoof, and proceeded to dry them with a handkerchief, "[i]Kllh dem, zal er ruen fridlekh[/i], I am sorry, young Lord. He died a good death. We lost too many good ponies tonight... Celestia sends her condolences."

"She... How is she? Did she say anything else?" Cadance leaned in.

Kibitz paused, trying to figure out how to answer. Then responded, quietly: "She seemed unwell. Distant."

Cadance nodded again. It seemed typical for Celestia sometimes, for better or worse. Trying not to let her fears run rampant, she turned to Blueblood, who stared at her blankly: "Brother, dear... I'm sorry. I truly am. I respected Duke Vsevolod and considered him my friend, even if we often didn't seen things eye-to-eye."

"Give me back my sword, Cadance," Blueblood demanded in an unfamiliar, quiet tone.

"You still not recovered fully, brother," she smiled sheepishly.

"Give me back my [i]weapon[/i], mare!" He roared, scaring her, and turned to nearby guard, "Your spear, quickly, you imbecile! I'll go and [i]carve[/i] out path through the changeling horde to the Castle itself, if I have to!"

"Belay that order," Cadance gathered herself and spoke with steel in her voice, then turned to Gleaming Shield, who already was done with his inspection, "Captain, Prince Blueblood is not feeling well. Let your charges escort him to the safe room, where he won't hurt anypony, most of all himself. Senior nurse Cheery Hooves will show you the one."

"I'm fine! I am perfectly fine! Don't you dare!" Blueblood growled, but no one listened to him. Three guards pinned him down and dragged away—at least at first, until the young noble found dignity to walk by himself.

Kibitz uttered remorsefully: "How pitiful... And the night is still only beginning, my young Princess. I believe, you can accomodate for me and my compatriots here? Some hot tea, perhaps?"

[hr]

The swarm was growing for the past dozens of minutes. More and more strain was laid down on Cadance, as she felt how the monsters try to break in. The rainclouds above the city poured down infernal amounts of water, making the rivers boil and go out of shorelines. Well, Cadance couldn't see the part about the rivers personally, but it surely [i]felt[/i] like it.

But then things changed, and Cadance called for a meeting.

"We have to do [i]something[/i], Your Highness," Stygian was looking worried, "Part of them split up, see?"

"It might be a trick."

"It might."

Cadance tapped on the windowsill, pondering. It was for the first time the swarm began to recede, and that meant that something is happening right now. With recent influx in forces, they may make a difference, and secure the safety of civilians. Maybe they have unexpected allies? It was unlikely... Whatever it meant, someone was presumably fighting nearby. Maybe even dying.

"When you're prone to waiting around, it is often perceived as a sign of weakness by others... You know, there's at least two remedies to any problematic situation," she said eventually, "First, you can try to figure out why you're in it. Second, you can get out. There's a catch, though."

"Yeah?" Stygian casted a wary look.

"These solutions aren't connected." She traced her hoof over the sword's hilt, pressing forehead to cold glass, "Not at all. Once you get out, you can just forget about that, but to figure out why it happened you might need to spend rest of your entire life—and all the while you will just sit on your ass with the problem unresolved."

Beam Flitter, one of her personal guards, chipped in: "So what action do you propose, Princess? We fight?"

"I [i]am[/i] an alicorn of Love, for what it's worth," she smiled grimly, "Let's parley."

Their ragtag proccession soon went out of the front doors, and made its way to the edge of the barrier. Cadance's army was pitiful: nearly forty guards, including captain and two crystal ponies from Crystal Empire, then Stygian, Blueblood (now considerably calmer), and Applejack, who just couldn't sit this one out. Despite all their achievements in the past, Cadance deemed other Elements as non-combatants, and demanded from them to watch over civilians. 

She did not wanted to risk anyone's life, if it is unnecessary.

"Think Chrysalis is there?" Stygian was holding a crossbow, itching for a target. Comparably huge, the weapon looked almost comical in his scrawny hooves.

"Ah reckon', she got too much on her plate," Applejack murmured, her gaze remaining directed to the changelings, who were coming closer to investigate.

Cadance tried to adjust the armor she pulled from one of the wounded soldiers, then sighed deeply. "Let's find out exactly that," she said quietly, "You know, I kinda even miss Chrysalis' mug already."

"How so?" Applejack asked.

Cadance leaned in a conspiratorial whisper: "I want to see it in [i]pain[/i]."

She smiled, pulling back, and looked through the barrier at the little beasts.

Dear Celestia, how she [i]loathed[/i] them. Her every nerve screamed to flee. One might not expect Princess of Love to feel repugnancy to any of living creatures, let alone whole species, but in this case she could made an exception. Their whole existence was a spit in her face, received literally.

They had no empathy, no value for others. Even greedy grown-up dragons, from her experience, could feel love and genuine affection. Changelings were [i]abhorrent[/i]. 

Their previous invasion of Canterlot happened fast and ended abruptly, 'an hour-long siege', Cadance joked about it later. In reality it lasted even less, but it lingered anyway like a poison, brought ramifications, and spawned many rumors and theories about what changelings do to their captives. 

Once, while trying to spare herself the grisly thoughts about what Chrysalis had planned for her back then, Cadance looked into it, hoping to ease her mind. Oh, how naive she was... It was the worst thing she could do. She learned about insects and their behavior, about ovipositors and laying eggs, and then about the usage of ponies as food source, with all that entails... She imagined these [i]food farms[/i], filled with green cocoons, envisioned how changelings could be trying to breed ponies as livestock, and finally, was horrified by her own possible fate, of how they could've tried to keep her alive for generations, subservient, broken in every way possible...

And then, there was unsettling truth about how many ponies hadn't been saved over centuries of their impermanent long struggle. During this time, many were overwhelmed by these treacherous creatures, only to perish in complete terror and darkness. Even now, recalling all she read about it, Cadance's stomach twisted, and her vision had gone dim out of sheer disgust. It was no wonder that collective ponydom quickly tried to heal, move on, and forget about nightmares of the changeling invasion each time they were repelled in the past.

Chrysalis will never get Equestria. Over Cadance's dead body.

The Princess took a few breaths, calmed herself, and looked at nearby changelings. They gathered almost at hoof's reach, their alien eyes stared without any discernable emotion.  

"I demand to speak with your commander. Bring him to us," Cadance requested loudly.

The beasts didn't budged. Cadance felt herself inadequate. Sensation of being trapped suddenly weighed on her tenfold.

"Am I not clear?" She raised an eyebrow, "Bring me your representative, if you have one. I am Princess Cadance of Equestria, ruler of the Crystal Empire, and I demand to speak with whoever in charge."

The beasts shared looks, and finally several of them dissapeared into the dark. Cadance suppressed satisfied grin, and then raised eyes, looking at barely visible silhouette of the Royal Palace in the distance.

Ponies around her were silent, bearing uncharacteristic grim expressions. Even Blueblood stopped whining about wanting a sword, and grabbed himself a spear. 

Cadance had a feeling of dreadful foreboding. As she looked upwards, she saw against clouded sky a slowly flying spectre of a horse, a windigo. It seemed to observe the situation, keeping at a distance. These spirits never were a good sign...

The changelings crawled on rooftops and walls before her eyes, amassing and getting ready for something. Soon, one of them separated, walking directly to the Princess. It was unlike the others. Three strange oval-shaped objects were embedded into its chest. 

There was something wrong with it... Deformed muzzle, jerked movements with each shaking step... It swayed, it pale eyes were open widely. It seemed old?... Malnourished?... Pathetic. It seemed pathetic.

"What is this?" Cadance smirked coldly, "I wanted to see a commander, not another underling. Where is your Queen?"

"N-now she is o-ours Q-queen, m-morsel," it replied in screeching tone, unpleasant to ear, lacking cadence. 

The Princess realised that she never heard any of Queen's minions' voice before. It was almost surreal. Despite all, until now she somehow just refused to believe that they can actually have conversation, and do it coherentily. "I wish to speak with Chrysalis herself. Where is she?"

"Busy. S-she is b-beyond your l-little concerns." 

"I have an information of utmost importance. You aren't aware where your real leader is, is that it?"

"It s-seems, we b-both will settle for an underling. I don't see Queen Celestia before me n-neither," the creature answered with bile, and chuckled to itself.

Blueblood leaned closer to her: "He's got you there, sister."

Cadance narrowed her eyes, not about to be humiliated by some nobody: "Who would [i]you[/i] be to have the right to speak with Celestia, anyway?"

Rich, long pause was her answer, and with each passing second, distorted grin of the changeling only grew wider. Cadance realised what it was going for, and barely frowned. It all felt childish... Eventually, when her guards began shifting and coughing in their hooves, the changeling broke silence: "You w-wanted to d-discuss your [b]surrender[/b], pony."

"Why would you say that?" Cadance spoke defiantly, still hoping to get some sliver of information from the exchange.

"You have no l-leverage. No o-other reason to talk," the changeling moved its milky eyes over ponies, "You're just b-bunch of scared, fat sacks of t-tender flesh. You're p-powerless, and you do n-not know what to do. You are g-grasping at st-straws."

Cadance realised she would need to take it more seriously. She took a step forward, raised shining horn. Her voice began to sound threatening: "You wouldn't wish to provoke me, little beast. I am a diplomat of ponykind, and I know that war is merely another method of diplomacy. Maybe the least effective one, but for you, monsters, it will suffice." 

The changeling wasn't impressed. A passionate vehemence rang in his broken words: "You g-got it all mixed up, mo-morsel. You kn-now no-not of what you speak. War is a [b]hunger[/b]... For beasts like us, hunger is never s-satisfied... We always at war with you. There w-will a-always be fear. A-a-always b-be war. A-a-always-s be d-death."

"There will always be love as well," Cadance said quietly.

"The world ne-never ch-changes. Everything f-flows, but everything remains the same," the insectoid screeched in a raspy voice, "We-weak will suf-fer. Strong will en-endure."

Suddenly, Stygian lent his voice, and it drew everyone's attention: "Why we can't coexist?"

The changeling went silent for a heartbeat, staring at the unicorn. Then asked, and it was clear how utterly repugnant the idea is to him: "Co-coexist? What? On y-your co-conditions? When is it pre-predators bowed to a [b]prey?[/b] Why have scraps and sops, when you can have it all?"

Feeling disgusted, Cadance hissed through clenched teeth: "High talk for [i]parasites[/i]."

Stygian pursed up lips, looking starkly with his pale eyes. His hoof moved to crossbow's trigger.

"Is this all there is to it, even now?" it was barely an uncertain whisper, but Cadance heard Beam Flitter pensively asking Ivory Rook, as they were close at her side, "Just everyone struggling and wanting to use one another?"

"[i]No, this isn't true! There's family, and fun, and friends, and joy of life![/i]" Cadance thought, her heart fluttered in anger, "[i]I'm sorry I couldn't show you, but I promise you, there is![/i]"

"This animal just doesn't know any better," she said out loud, boisterously, "Look at it, all it can do is to destroy and perverse. So what if it wags its tongue around? How does that justify anything?"

"I j-just m-might know some th-things, believe me," the changeling quipped, "I know how you ponies are tricksy, [b]tricksy[/b]... All ho-hoarding love to yourselves, all the time... To get it out of you is a re-rewarding challenge."

"Sister, you're right, why do even listen to this? What for?" seething with rage, Blueblood brandished weapon, "Remove that barrier."

Cadance turned, frowning, and her breath hitched, as she looked back at ponies. They were livid, perplexed. Applejack met eyes with hers, and it was strange to see helplessness from usually confident and dependable mare.

Stygian spoke tensely: "Fighting them would be unwise. We would be just overwhelmed in open field."

"Yes-s, that is right..." the changeling, that obdurate monster, grinned, as he was joined on his side of the barrier by others, "We-we w-will be victorious, pony. It is inev-evitable."

"Then what are we doing here!?" Prince Blueblood glared, agitated, "These barbarians killed our families, and what, we came out for some [i]peace[/i] talk? Cadance, aren't you an alicorn? Can't you just destroy all of them, and spare us this menace!?"

"I am sorry for your loss, Vladimir. Even one death is one too many. Any death is one too many. It isn't a reason to let vengeance cloud our mind," Cadance uttered, but lack of emotion betrayed her. She knew she managed to find the right words, but she wasn't sure she believed in them right now.

She noticed how Applejack glanced at her again.

"Gah! Quit it with proselytizing," Prince Blueblood growled, "You really want try to excuse that? [i]That[/i]? Where is your [i]honor[/i]? You're supposed to be royalty! To protect us!"

It was all a mistake. You can't be 'diplomatic' with those who treat you like prey. It will only make things worse, she knew it, and yet made this juvenile mistake... 

"W-we need to return and reassess the situation," Cadance mumbled, taking a look at the castle. Maybe they achieved what she wanted and served as a distraction, after all. She beckoned Captain Gleaming Shield to follow, and turned. He did so begrudgingly, silent dissatisfaction was all over his muzzle.

She heard how changelings laughed.

"Run! That's right! Run! Tug your tail and run!" 

"Weak!" 

"Worthless!"

Cadance's ear twitched and she rose her head high, trying to suppress the urge to launch at them. Later. She will make sure that the hospital is guarded, she will come for Shining and Twilight, and do it all without unnecessary bloodshed. The situation is still salvageable...

She stopped in her tracks, stiffened from the sudden sound of racket and shrieks. She snapped back.

A ray of powerful magic, of which Cadance had never seen before, tore itself from the side of Royal Palace. It went across several towers of the city, demolishing them, then grazed the Canterlot Mountain. Tremendous rumble closed in and engulfed everything.

"[i]They are fighting![/i]" Cadance thought, her wings flared, "[i]She is fighting! They are fighting with her![/i]"

Everyone, ponies and changelings alike, watched in stunned silence. For a few long moments there was stillness, and those beautiful towers kept crumbling, deforming the sight to which Cadance was accustomed since foalhood...

The ground under her hooves quaked. 

The whole city trembled. 

It cried like a wounded beast. It had a booming voice, terrible and inequine:

[center][b][size=2.5em][b]"ENOUGH!"[/b][/size][/center]

[canter]Blinding flash![/center]

It became bright as day. From the castle, in every possible direction, a powerful light of ancient magic beamed. The building convulsed. 

The haunting demand, filled with ire, was echoing:

[center][b][size=2.5em][b]"ENOUGH!"[/b][/size][/center]

Cracks went across pavement and walls of nearby buildings. The rain stopped for few moments, the dark clouds, lit from beneath, swirled in incandescent grey. Everyone cowered in terror. Cadance heard how someone whimpered, heard praying voices, asking for mercy.

[center][b][size=2.5em][b]"ENOUGH!"[/b][/size][/center]

Something impossible happened, the mountain of Canterlot, ever present on the backdrop, jerked up. [i]No[/i], Cadance realized, it is the platforms on which the city was nestled, sagged down. Despite having wings from birth, the alicorn got gut-sucking empty feeling, as if she is about to fall...

Several lightning bolts struck into Canterlot, one went directly into barrier overhead. Not expecting that, Cadance cried from pain in her horn, and her magic immediately dissipated. Heavy rain, wind, scorching smell, still subsiding heat, everything of it rushed on ponies, overwhelming all senses.

Cadance saw how Stygian, one of the few who wasn't dazed by what just happened, stood tall and pulled the trigger of the crossbow. The changeling commander's head jerked back, and he rose on his hindlegs, while helplessly flailing hooves. The bolt was lodged deeply into his eyesocket. He took a step back, keeled over, with surprised expression on his muzzle. Frightened changelings scattered away from the body. 

"Strike! Strike them now!" as Stygian's voice was almost drown out by thunder, he threw away crossbow and drew a short sword, "For the Princesses!"

The source of blazing light was quickly dissapearing, giving way to the darkness. The ponies charged, dragging Cadance along with them. Pushed by bodies from every side, overtaken by ardor and screams, she worked her hooves until she found herself in the midst of chaotic battle.

She tore sword from the scabbard, trying to figure out where the enemy is. Despite tutorship from many mentors, including Celestia and Luna themselves, she didn't expect to use her skills in practice.

Her crystal guards were gone somewhere. Searching for them, she ran forward, noting how Blueblood was clumsily piercing one changeling with a spear, or how Applejack bucked other one in the wall. A shadowy creature leapt at Cadance from above, she caught it with aura, slammed forcefully on its back. With a practiced movement, she pressed the edge to enemy's throat.

In sparring it would've meant that her partner is beaten. The changeling looked at her in fear, its lips moved, blubbering something. Cadance hesitated, panting from the rush of adrenaline.

Despite all her bravado, she had never taken anyone's life before. It was like taboo to her, as the Princess of Love. She could withstand death and tough decisions, but an actual armed conflict, even after everything, so far seemed like something from a telltale book about princesses and knights—not [i]real[/i] ones, of course. 'Not in Equestria,' she wanted to think. 'A pity. It would be fun. Maybe even romantic.' 

After all, just like always, there's another day, a better day of tomorrow, when everything could be resolved...

"[i]Maybe I can just take the creature into custody. We can talk and figure it out. It is afraid, it is beaten. Killing it wouldn't be right, I must try to show kindness, make an example... And it is small...[/i]"

Evading the blade by inches, the beast lunged forward, and sank its teeth into her shoulder, barely missing neck. Cadance whinnied in disgust. She pierced the changelings' side and pushed down, feeling how her power is [i]leeched[/i] by the monster. [i]Not again![/i] She pulled away and brought weapon on the creature, then once more, and it went deep through the treacherous beast's chest.

Cadance collapsed down on the hilt of sword. Her unkempt wet mane sticked to her shoulders and back. Her little tiara fell into the dirt. She watched as the creature was agonizing and succumbing to nothingness, as last vestiges of life were leaving it in ragged slow breaths. With its last breath, it smiled.

It felt like a dream, or maybe it was like an awakening. 

Death, like always, wasn't pretty. Just stupid and swift. The Princess of Love felt absolutely nothing, though. There was no remorse, no grand revelation about herself, now that she sullied her hooves. 

She remained exactly who she always was, and it frightened her the most.

"[i]It is normal. It is an abomination, a monster, right?[/i]" the Princess tried to calm herself, looking around. 

Barely few minutes had passed, and the changelings were already beaten. She saw how the last of them were fleeing toward the Upper Canterlot. Right where her husband and sister-in-law had remained.

Stygian was walking to her, cool and collected. "[i]Just monsters, right?[/i]" she tried to think again, as her gaze fell on other dead beasts around.

"Your Highness? Are you hurt?" The strategist helped her to stand and retrieve weapon with royal regalia. She nervously shrugged with a wing, and felt calmer, seeing that her crystal guards are unharmed.

In fact, everyone was unharmed, not considering few fresh cuts and bruises. There was no celebration of victory, however. They looked at each other, completely at a loss, doubting that they made the right decision.

"What was that light?" Prince Blueblood had wild glazed look on him, still reeling from recent shock, "Did you all heard that? Saw that?"

"Do you think it was Princess Celestia?" asked someone from the guards.

"No, it couldn't be..."

"But it was her voice, Is it?..." 

"Enough chatter!" Gleaming Shield barked, and casted her an expectant look. Cadance blinked once in confusion, before she remembered that she is in charge.

"Thank you, captain," she said hoarsely, "I am going to investigate. Stygian, you have an authority to act on my behalf. Protect the hospital. Ivory, Beam, you're with me. Let's do it quickly."

"As if I would listen to—" Vladimir began speaking, with reddened cheeks.

"Ah'm coming with," Applejack cutted him off, nodded with ardor, "Ah need just five to ten minutes, Your Highness. Haveta call other girls, and then, we'll find Twilight, and Shining too. We will take back whole Canterlot if need to!" 

Cadance smiled warmly at the sight of it. Twilight's friends really were wonderful, aren't they? Without hesitation, the Princess turned to others: "Guards, restrain Applejack and lead her back to the safe place."

"Wh-huh? What?" Young mare peered at her in confusion. 

"You heard the Princess," Gleaming uttered with a bit of a pause, and his stallions surrounded the farmer. 

Applejack exclaimed in frustration, recoiling from spears: "Uh, Your Highness!? What in tarnation is going on?"

Cadance heaved a sigh, and spoke in stentorian voice: "A while back, Celestia told me that the Elements might be the last hope for Equestria. She made me promise to her, that if unexpected happen and things go sour, I'll try to preserve you. I am not about to squander this hope without knowing what is going on. I will risk no one else."

"B-but," Applejack stammered, surprised, "we don't even [i]have[/i] Elements, they're broken, they... What sense does that makes right now!? We managed without them!"

"Who said that they can't be fixed somehow? [i]Hope[/i], Applejack. While you're alive, there's still hope," Cadance turned away, resolute, "I've made my decision. We're done here."

She proceeded forward fast, mostly because she couldn't withstand more questions. Few tears traced down her muzzle.

"Hope... Hope... Hope!..." She whispered, almost called out, as she walked deeper into the darkness. When all else fails and future is filled with uncertainty, what else there to do, but be hopeful?

[center]═════════════════════════════ 𒀭𒀭𒀭 ═════════════════════════════[/center]

𒄈 [b][size=1.1em]T[/size][/b]hey walked, then switched to gallop. Didn't gone far, just down the road and few turns. Cadance's horn shone, and she covered them in the shroud of invisibility.

"[i]Shining went here,[/i]" she thought with warmth, "[i]By Celestia, what an idiot. What idiots we both are.[/i]"

"Your Highness, if I may inquire, what is our plan?" Ivory Rook cleared his throat, looked down on his transparent legs with child-like wonder.

"Lower your voice," she asked. They reached one of the numerous bridges of the city. It was fastest way from the the hospital to the Royal Palace in the Upper Canterlot, maybe even the only viable one, given the circumstances.

Cadance glanced around, then turned to her ponies. Something at back of her head noted that she is mimicking Celestia's posture, complete with slightly lifted foreleg. Seems it definitely became like a second nature to her. 

"I want you to find a place to hide, and then watch this spot. If you meet here Prince Shining or Princess Twilight, try to give me a signal."

"A signal?" Beam Flitter was perplexed, "But Princess, where would you be?"

She nickered, and flapped her wings, soaring into the sky and removing them from the field of her magic. Suddenly visible, they glanced above in confusion, trying to discern where she is. 

"This is not farewell. I'll come back soon, my ponies," Cadance assured quietly. She began flying higher into the rain and to the clouds, until she remained completely alone, with no one to worry about but herself.

And now...

What now? After all that happened, flying and feeling the rush of wind was uplifting. She spread her wings, looking over the damage the fighting had caused. She wished that Canterlot was just asleep and did not look so dead.

The changelings were easy to spot. If Canterlot could be seen as dead, then they were like flies, feasting on carrion. They were roaming the narrow streets, still numerous enough to be a threat, and seemingly sacking the city. Cadance saw how they were engaging in random fights, or dissapearing inside the houses, crawling in and out of the broken windows. She shuddered to think what was going on in there, and what could be happening to ponies that were still alive.

Cadance's heart was aching. If Celestia had won her battle, she would've surely made them stop already. Her ancient castle was awfully quiet and dark. No sign of anyone. 

In dread of what she could uncover inside of the castle, Cadance forced herself to fly instead over the changelings, who were ammassed at the square in front of it. Amidst torn decorations of celebration that never occured, they wandered like insects and beasts, paying no mind to their own dead and wounded, keeping stalking in search of the food. 

In spite of everything, they persisted. There was at least few hundreds of these creatures.... Was Canterlot truly lost to them? Just like that, barely in span of one night? Cadance began to realise that her hopes might be in vain. She barely saw anything down below. 

In silent prayer, she closed her eyes. 

Was it really so grim? She stubbornly refused to despair. Even if war is inevitable, it would be a war of liberation. The changelings could be beaten, the broken can be fixed...

A gentle light fell on her muzzle. She looked upwards and saw the stars twinkle in the vast blackened sky. As if by some unknown magic, the clouds were slowly shifting and parting, and all the while Cadance kept looking in complete astonishment, captivated by the ethereal beauty above her.

The silver glow of the Moon shone, stealing her breath. Its radiant beams illuminated the landscape, casting a surreal glow on everything it touched. Cadance couldn't help but feel a sense of tranquility wash over her.

"[i]Cadenza, you really are an idiot. You're only lost when your spirit is broken[/i]," she thought to herself, looking anew at the charred city below her.

There were so many times when others expected a miracle from her, and now she was reminded by how they felt. It was as if unseen force was helping her. In the light, she saw familiar white coat of a unicorn, unconsious, dragged by pair of changelings across the castle's courtyard.

Cadance drew a sword and folded wings, falling on them like a bird of prey. They barely had time to react, and this time nothing could stay her hoof. Blueblood's blade went through them like butter.

With deed's done, Cadance pulled Shining on his back, fearing the worst. He was singed by flames, with a gash across his shoulder, numerous bitemarks. Cadance searched for any signs of life. He was barely breathing.

"Dear, please, wake up!" She whinnied in low tone, hunching over them. Should've brought some water, a medicine bag, [i]anything[/i]. Her hoof helplessly went over the husbands wound.

"My knight... Darling..." she whispered tearfully, and tried to pull him from the ground, while keeping the invisibility field active. Even with all her strength, she failed. Shining remained completely unresposive.

She pressed muzzle against his chest, crying. It couldn't end like [i]this[/i]. She couldn't just leave him [i]now[/i]. She could maybe found some cart, or dispel invisibility and lift him with aura, but... the changelings...

She willed with all of her heart for Shining to be fine. And then, before her eyes, just like years ago, a small apparition of magic went from her horn and touched Shining's torso.

He coughed, wheezed, taking a breath. Curled up moving aside, and barfed out a pool of green slime. Cadance held him in her hooves, while he was slowly regaining his senses.

"It's alright... Everything's gonna be alright," she promised, trying to be brave for him.

He glanced from under lock of hair, wet from sweat and blood. "You're beautiful," he groggily whispered, and spewed down last of the liquid. 

Cadance smiled weakly, studying his wounds. "Can you walk?"

He grasped at her with healthy foreleg, and pulled closer. She squeaked under the weight of stallion body, when he tried to lean on her. "Sorry," he mustered, still delirious, "Where... the others?"

"I am alone," Cadance answered warily, trying to take a step with him. 

Shining wriggled in pain, beginning to pant faster.

"Is castle safe?" She asked, and heard how Shining chuckled through the pain.

He looked at her with weird undiscernable expression, uttered something under his breath.

"What? Shiny, please... What happened?" A cold feeling was in her stomach, "You're acting strange."

"Celestia." His muzzle scrounged, and he shook his head, "She turned Twilight to statue."

Cadance stiffened. They stopped shambling forward and stared at each other for a few seconds. "That is impossible," she replied in shaken tone.

"Saw it with my own eyes."

"No, it's a lie. A trick. A changeling's illusion."

"N-no, Chrysalis, she... She... [i]She[/i], I believe, remained unharmed..." Shining's grasp on her strengthened, and he pulled Cadance even closer, "Love, how much do you know about Celestia?" He asked in weak, yet determined tone.

Cadance cast a fearful look at the castle, looming above them. "What [i]should[/i] I know?"

Shining was silent.

"You think she fell after all?" Cadance asked again, forcefully, "To the Darkness? To Chrysalis?"

Her husband licked his dry lips, and hung his head. "Listen, dove. I want you far away from her. From them both. From their schemes."

Cadance could hardly believe what she heard. "Shiny, darling, you're not yourself. "




They began crossing the cortyard, 


Она летит в невидимости, пытаясь разглядеть хоть что-нибудь. Затем, будто бы по волшебству, облака расчищаются и Луна светит ярко.

Skies cleared up and she gasped in astonishment, looking at clear Moon and Her light, at all magnificent stars. It was a miracle.

As if unseen force was helping her.

"My knight"

"Celestia is under her control?"

"I do not know."


"Stay with me," she whispered to Shining

"She... Twilight..." Shining chuckled deliriously.

"Celestia... turned Twilight to stone."

"What?" 

"To stone, dove."

"But why?"  Why would she do that?"

Canterlot looked unfamiliar.

She stiffened, leaning on Shining. 

There was a [i]solution[/i] to their problem.

To take the love, freely given. It would be the [i]right[/i] thing to do, wouldn't it?


It was exceedingly rare feeling for Cadance, to have such strong repugnancy to any of living creatures. 

Cadance was filled with loathing.


Each word scraped out of her throat. "Twilight had lost. Celestia turned her to statue. I am coming back to the Crystal Empire."


Lithe frame

Her movements were fluid and graceful, yet also powerful and precise.

Empathy was something that connected everyone in the world. Through it, people could know and understand each other, 

Any fool who opened up to these creatures was like a prey caught in a snare, and was treated as such.

She was living in expectation of grandeur...

 Cadance is still fearful of having her whole world turned upside down without a moment's notice. Even if she manages to let her guard down for a few moments, she will always know that it can all very suddenly come crashing down around her again.

"I won't give in to them alive again, Shining." 

"Neither will I." He answering grimly, his eyes constantly surveying the magic barrier for cracks.

"So... what should we do?" Cadance asked. Her gaze lingered on Shining's sword.

Shining looked back starkly. Then, he smiled. "What, are you going to give up, Cadance? That easily? Before breaking all teeth in Chryssie's snide grin?"

The Princess of Love grinned, and a spark trembled in her eyes: "Never!"

"You won't leave Flurry alone, won't you?"

"Of course not!" she hissed fearlessly. His love! All that she needs is his love. Warm feeling was washing all over her... 

Cadance turned away, watching how monsters began to try to break through the barrier even more eagerly.

"I think I have enough magic for a teleportation spell." Shining uttered grimly, still looking at her. His horn flared, charging energy. "But it will be wild. I'm out of practice with long distances."

"Whatever, just to get out of here is enough. They I'll fly us out."

"Great. Brace yourself. And give 'em hell."

Her ear twitched, and Cadance turned. Her eyes widened: "Love?..."

Spell hit her immediately. She didn't react fast enough. Sensation of vertigo overwhelmed her, she realized the she is flailing as she is falling through the air. Something colorful appeared before her, and she instinctively raised forelegs, protecting head.

– Находясь в жопе, ты можешь сделать две вещи.  
  
Во-первых – постараться понять, почему ты в ней находишься.  
Во-вторых – вылезти оттуда.  
  
Ошибка отдельных людей и целых народов в том, что они думают, будто эти два действия как-то связаны между собой. А это не так. И вылезти из жопы гораздо проще, чем понять, почему ты в ней находишься.  
  
– Почему?  
  
– Вылезти из жопы надо всего один раз, и после этого про нее можно забыть. А чтобы понять, почему ты в ней находишься, нужна вся жизнь. Которую ты в ней и проведешь.

It was something that Cadance was directly struggling with for all of her life. As she discovered in time, love in many respects was about managing fear in yourself and in others. Fear of expectations, of relations, of responsibility, of trust... Love was just as deep and intricate as fear, and two emotions couldn't be more entwined and be different of each other at the same time. 


A toy, mounted on his wrist.

"Think I'll go say old Chryssie 'hi' myself,"

"Twilight will manage," she repeated the same thing she told to the girls before, and then felt a sting of conscience. 

"I'll just make sure that she will," her husband smiled warmly, "It'll be easy. One hoof there, and one hoof here, you know how it goes."

"I'm coming with," she said resolutely.

"No, you will stay back for Flurry's sake. 'sides, Crystal Ponies will go bonkers if they lose their Crystal Princess. "

 He was right, she needed to admit. Instead, she clenched her teeth and looked directly in his eye.

"You are a fool."

"Yeah," he hummed, keeping gearing up.

"Why are you always making it all so complicated?"

"Yeah."

"You're completely not thinking about me. About us."

"M-hm."

Cadance made a long exasperated groan. She leaned forward, looked deeply into the Shining's eyes: "Why I married so heartless bastard? You're absolutely despicable."

"Because you love me." He pecked her cheek, passing along. She made a subtle step after him

"No, I hate you. Hate you. You hear?"

He smiled with that foolish smile, that fooly fool. He grabbed the sword, tested how it slides out of sheath, and turned away. 
"So, will it be the last words that you've ever said to your husband?"

"Yeah!" She smiled widely, tearing up. "Come back alive for better ones, you fool."

He chuckled, glanced at her mischievously over the shoulder, and simply nodded.

Каданс ненавидит чейнджлингов


Cadance: "I am a diplomat, and war is merely a method of diplomacy. Maybe the least effective one, but with you, monsters, it will suffice." 
Changeling: "You got it all mixed up, morsel. War is a **hunger**... For creatures like us, hunger is never satisfied... We always at war with you."


Про то что делают чейнджлинги с захваченными (как думает Каданс)

"Queen of Equestria demands your surrender, ponykind. You will be looked upon well."

Empathy is what connects us all, and holds this world together

Готовятся к битве с чейнджлингами. Затем ENOUGH Целестии заставляет их всех притихнуть, и взрыв, и на несколько секунд все становится светло как днем

Все напуганы
Взрыв почти уничтожает башню

Принц Блюблад

Стигиан пользуется замешательством чейнджлингов и нападают на них, застреливает из арбалета командира, и затем они пользуются преимуществом

EUP Guard.

Soon, the waiting began to gnaw on her immensely.

Стигиан пытается отговорить Каданс бросаться в город, но она его не слушает

про то как Флаттершай ведет себя странно

Dear Celestia, how Cadance hated changelings.
Disgusting creatures.

Pity and disgust, and fear

"How can such creatures even exist?"

No honor...


Her movements were fluid and graceful, yet also powerful and precise.
