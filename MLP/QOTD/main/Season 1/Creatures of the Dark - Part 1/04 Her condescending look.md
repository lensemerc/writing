Standing on a balcony, Celestia was observing peacefully sleeping Canterlot.

The last sip of the cold tea traveled down her throat, and now, supported by a golden aura, the cup slowly rotated at her side. It was covered in slight cracks and was repaired many times over, but it was beloved and was bringing back warm memories nonetheless.

It felt like many things in Equestria, sadly. It felt like herself.  

"[i]A gift from Princess Prospera of Seaquestria. May our alliance never be tarnished[/i]," she reminisced. 

The teacup was three hundred and seventy-one years old, and Lady Prospera was no longer alive. Her descendant by the name of Novo wasn't fond of tea meetings, but she was an acquaintance of sorts, holding no small power in the water dominion. The last time she and Celestia met was long ago, during a rare occurrence of a trade dispute between Novo's diminished land and Southern Equestria. 

Still, even if she couldn't relate to most of the other rulers of this world, Celestia was curious if any of them had the same trouble with their younger siblings. It was very doubtful, of course. 

The problem with being [i]exceptional[/i] is that your source of learning is mostly your own mistakes, and the last time Celestia neglected Luna's feelings, it all ended grimly.

Her thoughts were all over the place.  

The realm of dreams failed to claim her that night. Celestia tried to go to sleep but always woke up mere minutes later, haunted by visions. It was very stressful, even dangerous for her as well as for others. Thus, Celestia did what she always did when she felt particularly overwhelmed: she relaxed, opened a cheesy novel, and indulged in sweets with some tea.

She saw only two solutions to her problem.

The first would be to cut off her emotions. The practice was not foreign to Equestria, and it needed only a simple ritual—after that, there would be no more danger of anything ever going out of control. She seriously looked into this possibility but deduced that, in the long run, variables would overwhelm the constants. Celestia was unaware of what she could become or how fast she would forget how to feel any love at all, and frankly, she was content with herself anyway. 

The second solution is to give in, but it also felt like surrendering herself to the unknown. She doubted if such a union was even [i]meant[/i] to be. She was afraid of even looking at Luna now, as appetence for her younger sister felt unnatural and wrong. And yet, in her dreams they were together.

When there are only two options, you have to make a third one. That is how Celestia lived all her life.

So she pondered about it, but really, she had already decided what to do.

"Good morning, Canterlot." When the time came, Celestia pushed upwards her Sun, and stood up, checking on the mirror. The golden glow filled the world and danced in her mane, but nothing could help with a frowning and weary look. 

"Smile?" she asked herself, and her frown eventually eased into a smile.

The Sun continued to rise, warming the air. Canterlot, the capital of Equestria, was beginning to stir. Birds chirped, doors opened and closed, and stallions and mares greeted the new day with her.

Celestia had given into this calm and somewhat drowsy feeling, warmly embracing the city. Everything will be reconciled when the time comes... Of that, if only of that, she was certain.

[hr]

One can see the city of the Spire of the Crystal Empire from miles away. The city shone brightly amid the cold. The Sun fell directly on the crystal-like, vibrant walls and reflected light in all possible shades of a rainbow.

This ancient city itself is like a prism of beautiful architecture made of crystal and stone. The ancient magic was passing through it and bathing the entire realm of Equestria in its warm benevolence and promise of prosperity. No small role in it could be attributed to the Crystal Heart, which was radiating the will of a calm and gentle future.

Crystal ponies welcomed the flying chariot of Princess Celestia. Several crystal pegasi flew in ceremonial patterns on the sides, escorting the visitor towards the entrance to Crystal Palace. Celestia felt how ancient magic washed over her body. She slightly pulled back, enjoying the sensation.

"[i]This place needs to be safeguarded at any cost.[/i]"

Celestia stepped towards a small welcoming procession. Princess Cadance already hurried to her, wearing a welcoming smile. Celestia lightly bowed as per custom, not willing to tower over others, but Cadance had none of that. She just embraced the guest, and with a warm glance, Celestia returned the hug. 

"I had not seen you for far too long, dear aunt," Cadance beamed and stepped away, barely containing her joy. "How are you? How's Twilight? Do tell me everything, please!" 

Celestia gave her adopted niece a slightly inquisitive, yet mischievous, look. There was no one better to protect the Crystal Empire than Cadance and her valiant husband, as it was their [i]destiny[/i], after all. And yet, life here was dull, and the excitement of the younger alicorn was only reinforcing this impression.

Cadance interpreted the look and raised her brow slightly. Her tone quickly became slightly more official. Ever the diplomat. "Is something the matter, Your Radiance?"

"Not at all, my dear. Just wishing to rest hooves after a long journey," Celestia yawned, covering her mouth politely. "Perchance, you can provide us some tea?"

Of course, Cadance knew that an unannounced visit must be very important. She welcomed her aunt to walk inside the castle.

The etiquette was for the sake of the show; however, talk of Cadance's troubles was genuine. Celestia listened, trying to appear as pristine and attentive as always. There were new orphanages, new houses for the slowly growing populace, and some new sights to behold in the vicinity. There was a planned expedition beyond the spine of the world via airships, but it was still in the distant future. Engaging in the conversation, Celestia made some political small talk and inquired about neighboring Yakyakistan.

Everything is fine here, even better than fine.

Celestia understood Cadance's boredom perfectly.

The door to a royal boudoir closed shut, Cadance pulled down her regal crown, and Celestia fell on the couch with a sigh of relief. She immediately began to levitate grapes from a nearby stand, inspecting the ceiling.

"Well, aunt, what is going on? You look bad," asked Cadance with concern and curiosity in equal measure.

Celestia took a long moment to ponder. She already knew the whole conversation ahead—they both knew each other well enough, and yet she had to speak with [i]someone[/i]. After all, that was the whole point of the trip. The senechal back in Canterlot was informed that the ruler of Equestria would be gone at least until five o'clock for the unplanned journey, and Celestia put everything related to her duties on hold until it was resolved.

"Tea first," Celestia replied nonchalantly, and she saw in the corner of an eye how Cadance completely reverted into that curious, smiling young filly that she knew so well. 

Celestia wasn't thrilled about it right now.

Tea was swiftly organized, and Cadance took a seat. Her ears perked in curiosity. Celestia looked her over and suppressed a groan.

"This is just so exciting!" laughed Cadance, eagerly stirring a spoon. She already caught on that nothing serious is going on—not [i]too[/i] serious at least. "If you would only see yourself, Celestia! You're blushing!"

"Do I now?" she replied, concerned, and felt how her blush became only more intense. "This isn't good. This shouldn't be happening."

"I gather you want to talk about something related to your feelings?" Cadance smiled. "I have a sense for things like that, so there's no hiding from me! Dear aunt, don't hold back on me. I'm here for you!"

"It's Luna," said Celestia hoarsely and huffed. "She... Well... It's just embarrassing."

"What's with Luna? Did she fancy a stallion? What, her elder, wiser sister didn't approve? She did something risque?"

"Oh, nothing so banal, I assure you." replied Celestia blankly. "She seems to have feelings for me. And, so, I seem to have reciprocated them. You are the only one who knows."

Cadence's brows shot up, while her smile remained mostly the same. Celestia looked intently, still from the corner of an eye, watching all the small hints of emotion on the younger alicorn's muzzle. After a few seconds of processing, Cadance politely coughed in a hoof and offered in an unwavering voice, "Would you like some cake for your tea, Your Radiance?"

"If you may, bring a pistachio one. It was just lovely last time, dear."

For a few minutes, Celestia had been left in solitude, combating an uneasy feeling. When she uttered those words, it was as if she acknowledged their truth and freed it from the confinement of her mind. There, it was [i]real[/i]. Yes, she is in this kind of relationship with Luna, or she very well [i]might[/i] be. There is no way back. 

It was painful. 

But she won't capitulate easily.

The Princess of Love returned with a confident smile, looking far more collected now. At least partially, Celestia would've preferred her to still be eager and childlike. Nonetheless, she appreciated her seriousness. Cadance brought more cake and tea and wisely locked the door. Celestia sat on the couch, helping her niece place plates and cups.

"Celestia, are you aware that you aren't an actual unfailing paragon of virtue?" Cadance opened the conversation with a modest smile.

"[i]The conversation, indeed[/i]," Celestia thought with a frown, focusing her gaze on the cake. "I [i]am[/i] aware, you can believe it. I require a friend right now, not whatever [i]this[/i] is."

"I understand. Celestia, as I've said," the alicorn of love pressed a hoof against her heart. "I'm here for you. Let's talk."

"Luna was speaking about marriage with me," said Celestia, sitting straight and dignified. "Naturally, I will not follow through with such a request."

"You want to reject her?" As expected, Cadance was not approving.

"Let's just say I do not wish to hurt her feelings."

"Didn't you say you reciprocated her advances? You might start sending mixed messages," said Cadance, concerned. "Aunt Luna is somewhat old-fashioned. You might want to be blunt with her..."

Celestia suppressed the urge to roll her eyes. She felt frustrated that she couldn't adequately explain her feelings, so, she looked Cadance straight in the eye and, after momentary hesitance, put on a warm and motherly smile. "Answer a question for me, dear Candlelight. What is love to you?"

"Why, what a curious question you ask, aunt, dear," mumbled the younger alicorn. "Do I seriously need to answer that to [i]you[/i], of all ponies?"

"Admit, [i]dear[/i], there's no one better to ask. I would like to hear your explanation, if you may."

"Love is..." Cadance pouted, thinking. "Well... at least a big part of it is a willingness to understand."

"Oh?"

That wasn't something Celestia foresaw, but it seemed fitting. When Cadance used her magic, it was usually directed at resolving the conflict peacefully—to casually reconcile a bickering pair, for instance.

"That is the root of any feeling of love that is not just a misguided infatuation or attachment," kept talking Cadance. "Internal acceptance, and subsequently, understanding. It is taking something into your worldview without the willingness to change what it is inherently. There isn't anything more loving for us than to truly understand each other and to strive to understand while we act on the feeling of love. While we are learning more, we are loving more, and by loving more, we make others stronger! And they make us stronger too."

A long sip of tea followed. It gave Celestia some time to think without making the pause seem awkward.

"I [i]understand[/i] why you decided to answer like that. Still, I find this definition somewhat disputable, my dear niece," she said, keeping up a neutral tone.

Cadance smiled knowingly. She was enjoying this small debate. "If you appear in a situation where you are willing to force your belief onto someone you love, wouldn't it strike you as odd?"

"Well, what if I want to help them become better?" Celestia chuckled, thinking about her ponies and all that she had accomplished. "You are ever a romantic, Cadance, though that's to be expected." 

"Celestia, [i]of course[/i] we need to support others and help them become better. To feel the struggles of others as your own is a basic empathy. It's just, if what you love and what it is are two different things, maybe you initially were in love with [i]idea[/i] of someone, not their true selves?"

The Princess of the Sun looked to the side, pondering. A few seconds passed in silence.

"I can [i]understand[/i] what you mean," eventually she replied. "Still, you seem to oversimplify."

"Aunt, dear, you've asked, and I gave you an answer. Tell me now about the whole situation with Luna. Would you change her feelings for your convenience?"

"No, I don't think so. After all, I've felt something similar for her too," answered Celestia with a frown. Something was off. She was sure about it now.

"You should embrace your feelings!" Cadance smiled widely. "There is nothing wrong with being happy with someone you love, right? We will all be happy for you, too."

There it is. This is what Celestia expected. She felt mild anger, but it isn't Cadance's fault. "So you would say that to fornicate with your own sibling is [i]fine[/i]?"

"Oh! Well, ah... I've figured that it's not necessary in your relationship." Cadence frowned, but then cleared her throat. "Don't give me that. You are godlike beings, immortal alicorns that are destined to govern the world long after anyone who could criticize will die out, and the other ones will be none the wiser." She winked. Cadance seemed to have an agenda now. "The fact that you remain loving sisters after hundreds of years of knowing each other in itself is a miracle."

"This won't be a good example." Celestia chewed her lips. "It's not helping, Cadance. You know better than to speak like that. I still would like to think of myself and her as just ponies, and to some extent, about you too. Thinking otherwise might lead to a darker path."

Cadance sighed, not answering, eyeing her piece of cake now. She acted like an offended child... 

Celestia realized that she was wearing an accusatory expression and tried to soften up. "I understand your point," she said. "I shouldn't act this way, and you are only trying to help. It's just that, if I may be [i]selfish[/i] for a moment, I see this affection towards Luna as a [i]weakness[/i]—"

"Affection is never a weakness," Cadance cut her off boldly, now truly offended. "Especially not to someone who is closest to you."

Celestia examined this display of righteousness. It might've worked on someone else. "I am supposed to be in control of my emotions. I need to be stronger than that."

"[i]Anypony[/i] can be a victim of their emotions. A wise pony once said to me that it's our actions, not our thoughts, that define us. It was you, Celestia. Open your heart to her. Explain everything."

"What if she doesn't understand my rejection?" inquired Celestia, curious if Cadance even realized what this possibility entails. "What if we fight again?"

"She is your [i]sister[/i]! Everything will be solved if you talk with her. Come now, Celestia, remember about Friendship."

Cadance spoke almost the right words, but she wasn't there and didn't see how manipulative Luna seemed to be. But to accuse her little sister of that while knowing how much she is suffering with emotions? That wasn't something Celestia was willing to do.

She found herself unable to say anything. Maybe coming here was a mistake. "[i]Her method of loving is through understanding, through parley, as if you are on a constant battlefield of wits,[/i]" she thought. "[i]Does she believe that everyone can simply talk through their problems?[/i]"

Still, Celestia assumed that she should have time to iron everything out. It's not like this problem can be solved in one day, either. 

"I've let all this happen." Celestia sighed, relenting. "I seem not to be a good sister, Candlelight."

"Don't be like that!" Cadance smiled. She stood up, walked to Celestia resolutely, and locked her into a hug. She was almost like a little sister, trying to console the older one. 

"[i]That's right. I have three little sisters now, in fact[/i]." This wasn't making things easier... The weight of responsibility only grew.

Cadance smiled, and Celestia weakly responded with yet another perfectly feigned smile. Maybe that wasn't a right thing to do, but it still was a [i]correct[/i] way of dealing with things... 

Whatever happens, [i]all[/i] ponies of Equestria must feel safe and secure.

"It's all just so stupid." The Solar Princess heaved a sigh, and they shared a small laugh, looking at each other with glistening eyes.

"Don't worry, Celestia! Just talk to her. Be open! She will understand you like no one else. After all, when we are afraid, we are pressing forward anyway and conquering fear with our determination," said Cadance candidly, reverting again into that child-like young pony with a big chivalrous heart.

Some time passed in calmness, and when Celestia relaxed enough, the Princess of Love pulled back. Finally seeing that Celestia wasn't perplexed, Cadance was pleased with herself.

As she should be.

"You know, you always look so unassailable to the common folk, so above these personal problems. I am almost glad to be reminded that you are the same as everypony else." Cadance snickered.

"I am almost glad of it as well. It feels new, doesn't it?" Celestia winked.

They both echoed another chuckle off of one another and then returned to the cake and tea. Cadance bit into the cake, once more chattering away about her life and recent troubles, as well as the joys of having a child. Celestia made a series of small, acute remarks, supporting ongoing small talk. It's not like Cadance needed to vent, of course—the elder alicorn just needed a distraction now, and they both knew it. 

To be honest, Cadance tried to emulate Celestia sometimes, and their personal talks were forever tainted by it. The Solar Princess never blamed Cadance for that. There are just not too many suitable authority figures around to pick from.

"Would you like it if I brought out the wine? We received a good batch lately, straight from Manehattan," offered Cadance with an attentive look. "I've been searching for an excuse to open it up ever since."

"Alcohol is hardly doing anything for me, dear." Celestia remained polite. "Besides, it muddles the thought, and I have enough on my mind already."

Cadance's smile was pleasant. "Well, about that. If you want any help, I will gladly be of assistance. Just ask! If you want me to talk with Luna, I will suspend every task I have and try my best to settle it. Maybe you simply require a third party, an intercessor of sorts?"

"Not to doubt your diplomatic skills, but it isn't something that I can delegate." Celestia slowly and solemnly shook her head. "I'll need to confront her this night. After all, our relationship is my responsibility to bear."

"We are family, dear aunt, and it affects us all. Please keep me in touch, will you? Shining and me will be waiting for your word."

"I know that I can rely on you both," said Celestia seriously. "However it turns out, I will take time to send a message."

Cadance's lips curled up in a small, sweet, precious smile. She looked up at Celestia with clarity in her eyes, slightly inching closer. Her tender voice fell to a careless whisper. "Time will pass, and your true feelings will be spilled anyway. You keep a secret only for so long. I am sure of one thing: however it turns out—[i]love will prevail[/i]."

[hr]

"[i]The Tree keeps rustling tonight[/i]."

She waited for nightfall like a condemned convict would wait for execution. Celestia tried to distract herself, but to no avail. Food had lost its taste, the ruling of the realm and succor had not brought her usual joy, and the beating of a pumped-up heart filled her ears. She couldn't even remember the last time she was so nervous. Almost enticing predisposition—if not for the circumstances.

She walked down the halls. It was far past the hour when she usually retires for sleep. The wide, spacious hallways of the Royal Palace were filled with her dark shadow, cast by crackling torches. Banners on the walls trembled upon a light breeze, bringing her a slight shiver. Myriads of distant, uncaring stars were her only witnesses. And of course, the risen Moon was also on display. It was shining especially bright.

Celestia steadied her breath. The younger sister was avoiding her for the whole day, which means she will wait in her chambers. Why wouldn't she? Despite the possible theatrics, she was always direct in her approach toward her desires, despite how introverted she might be.  

Recollecting herself and recalling her talk with Cadance, Celestia slowly opened the door.

"Took you long enough," welcomed Luna in a slightly echoed voice.

She was standing still on a balcony adorned with flowers. Her gaze had been raised upward, and her ethereal mane flew from her shoulders, in an image stark enough to the point of utter deliberation.

Celestia took a small step forward. Her eyes widened.

A dark, form-fitting dress hugged Luna's smaller, slender body. The dress drew attention to her curves, and as if it were a natural continuation of her celestial aura, it was sparkling with shining stars with the slightest movement. Luna glanced askance, and Celestia felt her own body cumbersome and strained in comparison. She couldn't help but feel envious of Luna's effortless grace and elegance.

Still, she couldn't let her mind go astray. Clearing her stunned expression, Celestia closed the door behind and stood at the center of the room.

The lunar demigoddess stepped towards her. The delicate fragrance of her perfume hit Celestia's nostrils—or was it again her natural musk, robbing of will?

"Moonlight. My Sister." The Solar Princess took a breath. She was almost pleading. "You look gorgeous. But, [i]understand[/i]—"

Luna kept walking toward her and Celestia backed away under the pressure. With wrongly placed hooves, she collapsed a small table with vinyl. Black records scattered around, just like Celestia's thoughts and sentences she wished to open the conversation with.

Her younger sister looked with brazen intent. "Are you [i]scared[/i] of me, Celestia?" 

Celestia huffed and drew air, taking in the smell. She closed her eyes for a few seconds, finally calmed her nerves, and had found inner balance. "Well done." Her voice took on a melodic soft-spoken tone, fitting for a mentor who would praise an exceptional student. She stared at Luna directly. "I never thought you'd be capable of something like that." 

Luna grinned smugly, and hummed with a happy mischievous look, "Hold that thought."

She pressed against Celestia's chest, and her heart skipped a beat. She looked from underneath, nuzzling with affection.

"I forgive you," said Luna, and the elder alicorn closed her eyes shut, going through a sudden rush of emotions. Her ear twitched. She heard a soft giggle...

Celestia shifted her forelegs, showing nervousness again, this [i]weakness[/i]. "You do?"

"Of course, big sister. I forgive you for everything there is to forgive: for my loneliness, for how we do not spend enough time together, for how tense you are in my presence... For how you sent me to the Moon. For our talk yesterday." With unfamiliar and yet welcoming eagerness in her words, the Princess of the Night placed forelegs on Celestia's shoulders. "Maybe it's time to use the power of friendship to finally correct all wrongs between us. You would like that, wouldn't you?" 

"You were rehearsing that, weren't you?" Celestia whispered.

"I'd be a fool to come unprepared for a meeting with my precious sister, aren't I?" Luna snorted and nuzzled yet again, now in Celestia's neck. "You know... Do you remember all those days when we used to spend together? Nights side by side... Our youth..."

Celestia's mind flashed back to far different and simpler times that existed many lifetimes ago—maybe even [i]too[/i] many to try and count. Celestia let out a trembling, trepidatious sigh. "I do," she answered, embracing Luna with great white wings. "It is a cherished memory. I remember how we were laying in bed and talking about our destinies and futures, and sharing our dreams. I was so content... And everything that has happened since then... We couldn't predict it, couldn't we? And I tried, Moonlight, I really tried my damnest to listen and to be able to hear. But it's like walking through the darkness, it is that accursed cave again. I'm so tired of this feeling of being so lost, to not be able to [i]sense[/i] the laid-out path anymore. To not see a [i]purpose[/i]."

"I am with you," assured Luna in a soft and quiet voice. "You can tell me [i]anything[/i], powerful Sun."

"Then... [i]do[/i] understand that your affection feels strange to me right now. It isn't something that was meant to be. How can we know that our feelings do not lead us astray?"

Luna slightly frowned; there was dissatisfaction in her expression. It was barely a hint, but it was enough for Celestia to notice. Luna caressed Celestia's mane and moved closer to a drooped-down ear. "Do not be afraid of the dark. Close your eyes."

In the dark, your main source of fear is your imagination, after all. Celestia submerged in it, feeling a warm and dry touch on her lips. The smell overwhelmed her, drowning out the disquiet inside. 

In the dark, there was nothing but a sensation, perhaps a forbidden one, but it was something entirely new.

She probed the texture of Luna's lips, feeling lightheaded from even the thought of what was going on... But, somehow, there was no conflict... Only enjoyment. There was a drastic pull—an intent realized in action. Celestia could imagine a long lifetime filled with such kisses. Filled with understanding.

No, not just a mere lifetime, for they would spend an [i]eternity[/i] together, truly each other, forever. Lovers, not just confidants.

Would it be so bad?

Their lips slowly parted, leaving Celestia with a sensation of longing.

"Are we still sisters?" Savoring the aftertaste, the Princess opened her eyes, watching how the distant moonlight was revealing the muzzle of her beloved counterpart.

Luna's gaze was unsettling. Silent, she was almost drenched in darkness. Fire danced in her trembling irises—a reflection of Celestia's worn golden regalia.

"Luna?" Celestia called for her and slowly made a gentle, loving stroke across her cheek.

It's almost as if it brought her out of a trance and broke her inner perplexity. Rapidly, Luna closed the inches between them and leaned into a quiet and ravenous kiss. Celestia gasped with a little involuntary "[i]ah!~[/i]", and stepped backward under this assault. Precious vinyl records cracked under her hooves. The Princess closed her eyes again, drifting...

It was... a strange... tingling sensation. A madly beating heart in the chest... A rush of blood, overwhelming. Celestia could hardly remember ever being [i]so[/i] emotional, so filled with [i]such[/i] feeling. "[i]Is this normal?[/i]" she had to check herself. "[i]No. Nothing about it is normal. Far from it.[/i]"

"Luna, we have to stop," Celestia heard her own voice as if it were spoken by someone else and pushed her little sister away. Almost surprisingly, but it worked, and Luna stepped back. Her cheeks reddened, her breath was fast and shallow.

"[b]How amazing[/b]," sister hissed in a hushed tone, and Celestia looked at her with worry. Not without some conceit, of course, but mostly with worry.

She just couldn't shrug off the feeling of irreality.

"Moonlight, are you quite alright? We should talk about all this, don't you think?" Despite Celestia's best efforts, her voice was low and breathy. 

"Maybe. Yes," Luna backed away with a content grin, pulling Celestia along. "Let's settle in and talk like we used to, my... good sister. I would like nothing more than that. You must be tired, aren't you?"

Sure, the long day burdened her, and Celestia was appreciative of this attentiveness. They both shared the wide bed, not bothering with removing any clothes.

Luna looked so happy now. It was a far cry from her usual more stoic or reserved persona, with which she masked her inner darkness and urges. It resonated with Celestia, making her feel unadulterated joy. Maybe this is just how someone who is in love with you looks up close? Maybe she too is looking like that right now?

It felt good. 

Anxiety had left her now. Wearing a gentle smile, Celestia sprayed on a bed, looking contentedly from under lowered eyelids. 

They are so near right now, and it was all that mattered: only both of them staring into each other's eyes, one lying against the other.

"Luna," Celestia called without a second thought. "What do you think love is?"

This simple question caught Luna unaware, and it was so adorable to see that Celestia giggled. 

Luna frowned. Her gaze darted, and she stirred like a child under duress. "I will tell you tomorrow night," she whispered back after a few seconds of thinking, with a promising gleam in her eyes. "When you will be more rested."

"Oh..." Princess mustered, feeling a tugging sensation in her stomach. A pleasant one.

Suddenly, Luna became more intense and leaned closer. Their hooves locked. "What about you? What do you think love is to you?" she whispered in a breathless voice.

"To me?" That simple question was unexpectedly heartwarming. Overwhelmed by tenderness, she smiled with all the kindness of her heart. She pressed muzzles with Luna. "What do [i]I[/i] think? Are you asking me?"

Luna tensed up for a second, but that did not linger for long. "Tell me."

"Sacrifice," Celestia answered immediately. "Love cannot exist without sacrifice. I understand the importance of putting others before one's own goals and ambitions and that love without sacrifice is as meaningless as money without wealth. I would do anything it takes to protect those I dearly love. This is my promise to them, and this is my promise to you. I will protect you, Luna, with everything that I have. You know that I love you."

The darker alicorn looked at her with pure glee. "Say it again."

"I love you," purred Celestia completely unabashedly, putting into these short words all her feelings.

Luna squirmed and then got even closer, embracing the big body of Celestia with a warm hug. They both shared it.

No more words were spoken that night. Drifting into calm sleep without dreams, Celestia's last thoughts were about how truly happy she is at this moment. 

Everything will be fine. It must be.

[hr]

Waking up was harder than usual. At first, Celestia did not understand what had happened or even where she was.

But reality came clear—she shared a bed with her younger sister, and that was something that almost never occurred ever since they were fillies. Celestia looked at Luna and took in her calm and precious visage. The corners of Luna's mouth were slightly lifted in a content smile. Their celestial manes entwined, and the stars sparkled together. Ancient magic never left any of them. It was here at their side in the dark, their silent witness.

Celestia rose to glance at the grandfather clock, and Luna opened her eyes startlingly fast. As looks were exchanged, her pupils got smaller, then dilated. 

"My Celestia," she said calmly, not moving.

Something primal was in her still body. It spoke a thousand words without uttering a single one.

The Princess of the Sun nickered and leaned back toward her sister, pushing muzzles with her. Celestia was overwhelmed with gentle and calm feelings, which she could now share with the one she truly loved. 

"Good morning!" Celestia cooed, satisfied with the pure bewilderment in Luna's eyes. "You skipped your night shift, you know."

"It appears that I did," replied Luna coyly, then narrowed her eyes, demanding more affection. "But it was worth it, wasn't it?"

Celestia laughed, feeling playful. "Just don't be so lenient with your duties! Ponies still need us."

"Well, what if I did everything while you were asleep? How about that?"

This whole new-found cheekiness of Luna felt so liberating. "I think I would've noticed that! Lazybones."

"Sunbutt." Luna grinned.

"What gall!" Celestia let out a dramatic gasp. "Inkflank."

Luna licked her lips, looking especially sly and yet serious at the same time. She took a deep breath, letting Celestia know that the next few words mattered. "Celestia—"

"Oh, quit the formalities already, little Moonlight." The Princess waved a foreleg in the air, already having some inclination about what her sister was going to say. "Now is certainly not the time."

Luna muttered, as if unsure. "...Tia?"

"Yes, love?"

"Tia, let us be married."

"Gladly," Celestia responded, nuzzling her. After all, a little sister is always a little sister, and she will have her little whims.

Yes, just like that. Just that simple. The shared candor made everything simpler and did put matters into perspective. With a radiant warmth inside, Celestia recognized that she had made many mistakes in the past, and this certainly wouldn't be one of them. Luna will be happier; no, [i]they[/i] will be happy together. They share everything but night and day, after all.

Her smile inspired Celestia with unimaginable joy.

"I am already imagining this perfect day, this perfect wedding," her dearest little sister spoke quietly, pushing the horn against hers and looking into her eyes deeply and intimately. "My Celestia... You fill me with so much love, I could just gobble you up."

The Princess of the Sun laughed heartily and pulled away. "I never imagined you would be so voracious, my Moonlight."

"I've longed for this for a while."

"Truly?"

"Really."

Celestia shook her head wordlessly, still laughing.

"When, Tia?" Luna reached out for her, but Celestia quickly stood up, evading the grasp.

Luna rolled over on her back, watching as she went. Her chest was heaving. Her eyes were wide open. Celestia couldn't stop staring.

"I guess you'd go and tell everypony, now?" Luna purred in an unfamiliar, sultry voice.

Celestia turned, trying in vain to hide her blush. "I guess, I will. Not yet official, of course. I will go and do all the hard work while you're lying around, as usual."

"Ah, that's a life, isn't it?" Luna suppressed a laugh. "Don't you worry, Tia. Just [b]wait[/b]. I'll pay you back splendidly for all your labor."

Celestia blushed harder, feeling herself in some kind of haze. She stopped at the door, calmed herself, and looked back intently. "Now then, Sister. Aren't we rushing this?"

Luna's gaze was piercing. "[b]No[/b]. We aren't."

[hr]

If there is one word to describe who Twilight Sparkle is, then it was [b]hope[/b].

This impression might be what connects Celestias through all possible timelines and universes, with the binding of an impossibly white stitch. Twilight was the inspiration for her, a symbol that meant that ponykind would persevere. Celestia knew that Twilight would become something far better, something far [i]more[/i] than Celestia herself could ever be.

Sadly, the Princess of Friendship was still fairly young.

Visiting her Castle felt like peeking into a children's playground when they sometimes have built-up houses on top of trees. 

Nonetheless, the Princess of the Sun truly enjoyed strolling down cozy Ponyville and walking up the staircase leading to the entrance. She trotted through its door, which was always open to anyone who might be in need, and navigated the hallways leading to the central chamber. Little alicorn was right there, immersed in research.

The first one to notice the guest was her stalwart assistant.

"Princess Celestia!" Spike exclaimed in surprise, gawking, and promptly tripped over a chair, which was pulled up to the wrong place.

Keeping up the smile, Celestia caught in the golden aura the books he was carrying around. Twilight jumped up from her spot, gasping. She involuntarily made that small, soft whining noise that was similar to the whine that dogs, cats, and other pets make when they see a familiar owner. She never noticed it, but Celestia? Every time. 

Celestia adored it absolutely.

"Princess!" Twilight beamed, trotting over, while Celestia was swiftly looking over the covers of the books she held.

"You were searching for something related to nature magic?" she deduced, upbeat. "Does Everfree Forest cause trouble again?"

"No, no, not at all," Twilight smiled sheepishly, tucking away her books. "There was just this small peculiar curse with Sweet Apple Acres. See, moles tried to move in and accidentally uprooted saplings. And then it turned out they were doing that only because snakes invaded their territory in the first place. And [i]that[/i] was because of the flood, because beavers did not expect rain to be so intense. [i]And that[/i] happened because of Rainbow Dash, she slacked off her job because she didn't have a good night's sleep. We with the girls are now looking into the problem, and I'm figuring out how to combine nature magic and friendship magic. Also, how to make Rainbow apologize to beavers, I guess."

"So, it seems you have your hooves full." Celestia smiled. "But I believe that Harmony will prevail because it remains within our hearts. Maybe you could invite ponies to help strengthen the beaver dam?"

"Well, yes, I might." Twilight rubbed her chin. "Though, isn't it what beavers [i]do[/i]? I mean, won't ponies somehow upset them or make things worse? It is enough that we caused a problem in the first place..."

"By helping each other, we will only make our bonds stronger," said Celestia with warm assurance. "I [i]know[/i] that you will find the correct solution."

There it was—that look in Twilight's eyes—a certain sparkle. A little push unraveled her brilliant mind from a perceived problem and led to some idea. The young alicorn gasped, promptly turned, and rushed somewhere to solve everything, but Celestia caught her with aura and placed her back on the spot. Twilight squeaked in surprise and looked attentively at the Solar Princess.

"Twilight, I would require your assistance, if you may." 

"Oh, right! I'm sorry. Spike! Take note." Twilight closed her eyes, striking a familiar royal pose. "We will learn from beavers how to make a bigger and sturdier dam, and we will welcome snakes to help us along. That will ease the moles' fears and show everyone that snakes aren't so scary in the first place. Then, I will lay an enchantment spell on it and explain how much it matters for everyone to coexist and to watch over the dam, and keep that spell functioning through the magic of friendship. Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash could help to look over it together from there on. That is all."

"Done and done!" Spike finished his eager scribbling. 

"Now, Princess Celestia!" said Twilight with an adorable grin. "How can I assist?"

"I will be married soon, and—"

"WHAT!?"

Twilight trotted around her excitedly, looking with big, precious eyes. "Princess! That's great news!"

"So it is. I would marry my little sister, esteemed Princess Luna," finished Celestia calmly, taking immense pleasure from Twilight's reactions.

Her protege did not disappoint, not one bit. Twilight blushed scarlet red, clearly flustered, but then laughed it off and did a little clap with hooves. "I'm so happy for you, Princess! Oh, that's a bit surprising, is all!..." 

"I ain't surprised," quipped her little dragon.

"Spike!"

"What?"

Celestia chuckled with a hoof over her mouth. She adopted a royal pose of her own. "Princess of Friendship, I hereby declare you and your friends as organizers of my wedding with Princess Luna. The whole of Canterlot is at your disposal for this task. Will you accept it?"

There was some hesitance and nervousness in the eyes of her former student, but soon she beamed and spoke fast, "Of course, Princess! You know that there is no better fit for it, and we have experience to hoof. I'll gather up the girls, and then we shall proceed with preparations. After we finish with the whole situation here, right?"

"Take your time, Twilight. I would prepare everything that is needed on my end." The Solar Princess pondered her next words. "If I may, I have one last question for you, as for my equal."

"Princess, ask me anything!"

"What do you think love is?" she asked, curious.

It was an interesting experiment of thought, and there was no less interesting reaction from Twilight. The little alicorn was stunned for a second, and then she raised her little muzzle. "Why, love? As in concept? Well, it is [i]everything[/i], of course!"

"Be more specific, please."

"The concept of love is complex, deep, and powerful. Love doesn't always make sense, yet it guides and moves every one of us. It is a great yet dangerous concept that can both help us grow and destroy us," responded Twilight adamantly. "If more specific, then, I think—" 

Twilight engaged in rumination, and Celestia remained silent. A dozen seconds later, Princess of Friendship emerged from it and flashed a coy smile.

"It's a force that binds together all living things, yes. No less than that. Would you like me to incorporate these words somewhere in the speech for your wedding?"

[hr]

Luna was late.

Celestia paced her quarters, thinking all kinds of thoughts about that. Night had already befallen the world, and already for an hour there was no showing of the necessary celestial object. The alicorn was ready to do this duty by herself several times over, but it was something she viewed as a last-ditch effort.

[i]Something[/i] had happened, and on [i]this[/i] night, no less. Not letting anxiety take over, Celestia relented and gave Luna another half-hour before she'd begin to scour the earth itself to find out what was going on.

And finally, when the time almost lapsed, the Moon slowly crossed the horizon line. Celestia sighed. All that's remained is to wait for the return of the wayward Princess.

It wasn't long. Her visage was flying high, striking against the Moon with a quick flourish. Luna was enjoying herself, moving right above the trees and houses of Canterlot, covering them with a fast-paced shadow.

Finally, she landed on a balcony before Celestia, and the older sister heaved another sigh, filled with trepidation.

"Did something happen, Moonlight?" She furrowed her brows, not able to be seriously mad right now, but worried nonetheless.

"Ah, I just had a little quarrel with my tribe of night ponies," said Luna with a grin, confidently strolling past her. She reached with a wing and traced the tips of her feathers along Celestia's cheek. "Nothing to worry about."

"Moonlight..." Celestia frowned, following into the warmth of the room. "It is no small matter. Don't you understand how important it is to raise it on time? You can throw off the whole magnetic field of the world! The patterns of ebb and flow of the tides, the intricate lives of all kinds of creatures, the magic ancient and new, the sleep cycles, the dream realm—every last bit of the world is connected and affects one another!" Celestia stared at the little sister with renewed worry. "Please, don't let it happen again! The balance is struggling already because of our frivolousness..."

Usually she'd show discontent at this outburst, but now Luna's smile remained calm and mysterious. She batted her eyelashes, placed her forelegs on the soft bed, and leaned and stretched like a cat. "We are already bickering like a couple, aren't we?" she murmured.

Celestia let her eyes slide down Luna's frame for a split second and then shook her head. Her voice sounded unacceptably weak. "Luna. Sister. All of it is serious. We watch over the entire world, you [i]know this[/i]. I might joke about it sometimes or pretend to be irresponsible myself, but if all these feelings affect us like this right now, we just might to... might have to..."

The Lunar Princess fully laid down on the bed. Amidst disturbed sheets, pillows, and blankets, she was looking longingly and deeply into Celestia's soul. The sheer power of her presence radiated from her lithe body, beckoning the elder alicorn to come closer. "Tia. My spouse. Quit yapping and kiss me," she demanded.

And Celestia obeyed. After all, she wanted this. She had spent all day mulling over how it would happen. Deeply amazed by Luna's boldness, Celestia blushed, moved closer to her, and then joined her in a warm embrace.

They kissed. It was just right, even excellent, sending a surge of goosebumps down her spine. Her heart trembled. She was elated.

"What are we doing?" She timidly giggled, once more overwhelmed by love and joy. "Luna, am I taking advantage of your feelings? It isn't right..." 

Luna gently shushed her, and they shared another kiss. Embraced, the two Princesses turned, and Celestia found herself underneath. "Tell me, my Celestia," Luna called in a soothing voice. "When will our wedding occur?"

"Soon, love. Twilight is already on it."

"Ah, Twilight, is it?" She smiled widely. "That is [b]good.[/b]"

Celestia remained transfixed by her beauty, giving into the growing passion more and more.

Luna remained graceful and calm, like the bend of a moonlit, clear river. She rose above. Her triumphant smile glistened in the dark. "Love me, Celestia," she said with an irresistible primal need.

"Yes."

"Say it out loud."

"I love you."

"Again."

Luna pressed against Celestia's chest. She descended to her muzzle. Celestia felt a warm breath on her cheek.

"I love you," she whispered. 

There was a sweet relinquishing of control. Something inside of her, so tense for hundreds of years, let go of the grip. She felt incoming tears and examined her own reflection in Luna's eyes: reddened cheeks, an unkempt mane... There was no denying it. She is completely enthralled.

"Love [b]me[/b]," the voice demanded of her, in the sanctuous rule of three, as if it were some incantation, a spell.

"I love [b]you[/b]," her answer was clear and confident.

There were fangs in Luna's smile. She looked deeply, caressing Celestia's cheek, and then her hoof hovered over the alicorn's throat.

"My darling Celestia. My adorable [b]pet[/b]."

"Luna—" Celestia croaked from another rush of emotions, from the sudden turmoil, not able to take action anymore. In Luna's eyes, there was a green shimmer that didn't belong.

"You wanted me to tell you what [b]love[/b] is, foolish mare?" Luna spoke abrasively, with a vicious snarl. "Why, I'll answer. Love is just [b]power.[/b]"

Celestia gasped. She still couldn't believe it. All the oddities, inconsistencies, strange behavior, and everything else that had amassed in the last few days instantly went through her mind. 

But she still had hope. She was always hopeful.

"No... No! What have you done..."

"Is it really what you're going for? This cliché?"

"Tell me it isn't true..."

"But it [b]is[/b] true."

"It can't be..."

She loves Luna. She loves her dearest sister despite everything. She can't stop this feeling inside of her; it just soars, and now it leeches from her, even if someone who deceived her never was Luna in the first place.

Humiliation and dread both washed over her, and love as well—this illogical, rapturous sensation.

"Tell me who I am," demanded the creature with a hiss, and Celestia could do nothing but obey.

"Chrysalis. It's [i]you[/i]."

Luna burst with a green witchfire and was concealed by a column of it that rose to the ceiling and abruptly ceased, revealing the cursed insectoid. Her gnarly horn flared, and another bout of magic quickly enveloped the room. Celestia recognized the spell: a sound-proof barrier. Now no one will hear her cry for help.

"Finally, my [b]old[/b] enemy," the Queen said, looking down with a stark, rancorrous gaze and a wide, toothy grin. "After all these years, Equestria is in my grasp... And you've given me so... so much [b]love[/b]..."

The Queen laughed, trembling in unadulterated, voracious malice. The Princess snarled, looking at this display.

She couldn't stop feeling vertiginous weakness, the urge to love.

To [i]sacrifice[/i].

"What have you done?" she repeated, summoning all willpower, however eroded it might've been, to remain calm in the face of danger.

"Ah, Celestia, but I haven't done anything!... [b]Yet[/b]."

"What have you done with my Sister!?" Celestia roared with tears streaming down her muzzle, but the damned changeling just grinned in turn.

"Wouldn't [b]you[/b] like to know? She is still alive, you know this. Don't you think about her-" Chrysalis reached back to alicorn, her visage blurred with heat of witchfire, her voice shifted in tonality, "-my betrothed..."

Celestia [i]couldn't[/i] fall like this, but despite all, in her heart, she always knew that beyond all the fleurs of status and unattainability, she remained simply a mare. Immortal and powerful, yes, but not that different from any of her ponies. 

Fake Luna kissed her eagerly.

Her heart was throbbing madly.

She responded, indulging in the fantasy for just a second.

A single second was all that it took.

A single second of weakness was a curious temporal paradox. It blossomed, quickly becoming a minute of weakness, then several, and each one of those seconds of weakness spawned more, and it could go on as long as the Queen wanted it to.

Celestia tried to fight, of course.

"Chrysalis, stop this madness before it is too late. Please, let us just speak..." she breathed heavily, trying to suppress the changeling's vile magic, dominating her mind.

"We're only beginning, Celestia, and you're [b]groveling[/b] already? Way to suck all the fun out of this." 

Her condescending look fell on her. Fake Luna sounded so accusatory that Celestia felt shame. "No, you do not understand. It all can be solved... There are other ways

"[b]Quiet[/b], pet."

Chrysalis' voice became lower and reserved. She leaned to Celestia's ear, which was drooped down in sheer fear. The cold yet contemptuous voice of an insectoid cut through the emotions of the Princess.

"You [i]can't[/i] stop this. No one can stop this anymore. [b]You[/b] can't [i]coax[/i] [b]me[/b]. You have nothing to bargain me with, and you have no power here. It's over."  

Celestia let out a trembling sigh. A few new tears fell from her muzzle.

"Why do you fear so much?" asked the fake after a burst of short laughter, satisfied by her own deception. "Why do you [b]cry?[/b] Aren't you a proud and strong alicorn, ruler of Equestria, wielder of the power of the Sun itself? Ah... I see. You are afraid of what will happen to your subjects. R-right?"

Celestia was pushed down, then onto her side. There was a grip on her flowing mane. A hoof crept across her sucked-in stomach to a spot where her body brimmed with burning warmth.

She slightly lifted her hind leg, feeling dread and anticipation—a truly vivid concoction of emotions. No one ever dared to touch her like that...

"I [i]am[/i] afraid," she gasped from a strong movement underneath but didn't lose a trail of thought. "Yes. I am afraid for them so much... I do not want my subjects to suffer."

"Any creature who would try to oppose [b]me[/b] would be torn apart by my minions, pet," a murderous glee resounded in the fake's voice.

Celestia shivered beneath the changeling. Her breath caught in her throat. Her chest heaved. Her vision began to blur.

"Any creature who would dare to displease me would be punished in the most [b]cruel[/b] and [b]painful[/b] way imaginable."

"Yes..." Celestia blurted out, not understanding what she responded to exactly: the steady movements of the Changeling Queen or her claims. She hated this; she was scared out of her mind... But her heart kept telling her that this would be what's best.

"I love you," Celestia groaned through inner pain, trying to ease it, and had bit on the pillow.

"My rule will be absolute, and [b]all[/b] of Equestria will surrender me their love!" exclaimed her tormentor and lover, her eyes glowing with green. "[b]Soon[/b], your wretched pupil will finish preparations for our ceremony... and you will be the first to surrender to me, Celestia. In front of everyone. Isn't it just magnificent!?"

"Yes... my Queen..."

Those words were so easy to say... this [i]my Queen[/i] came out so naturally. Celestia's eyes glowed with affection, her voice was filled with desire, and yet she was full of fear.

Through the guise of Luna, the real body of Chrysalis began to bleed into the world with a searing green glow. She embraced the defeated alicorn, holding her tight amidst the silken covers and pillows.

"You will bow to me at long last, Celestia," Chrysalis hissed a malicious whisper. "You will succumb to me soon, too."

If someone had told Celestia before that the final struggle to decide the fate of Equestria will occur in her bedroom, she would've been amused by it to no end.
