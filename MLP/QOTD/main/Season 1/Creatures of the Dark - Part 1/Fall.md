I have an ambition...

It sings.

Wind chime at the window.

It sings.

I hear the laughter.

It sings.

Silver Shoals. A good place.

It sings.

We've built a lot together.

It sings.

They need more space.

To be free. 

We can watch a play, if you want.

To be free. 

I wanted to feel it again.

To be free. 

To read all the books in the world.

To be free. 

To go anywhere we want.

To be free.

What is a true strength?

To be free. 

We have a millennia to catch up on. 

[opacity]An [i]eternity[/i].[/opacity]

The [b]White Tree[/b] rises.

The world is growing.

The [b]White Tree[/b] rises.

Do you regret?

The [b]White Tree[/b] rises.

Are you ashamed?

The [b]White Tree[/b] rises.

Can you relax?

The [b]White Tree[/b] rises.

No more fear.

The [b]White Tree[/b] rises.

Let it go.

Gracefully.

Happiness must be earned.

Gracefully.

Do I deserve this?

Gracefully.

I want her smiling.

Gracefully.

She'd forgive me.

Gracefully.

They'd understand.

Gracefully.

No one will hurt her again.

Harmonious.

It is a good dream to have.

Harmonious.

No one will hurt me again.

Harmonious.

I've learned how to be strong.

Harmonious.

No one will hurt us again.

Sister, we will be free.
