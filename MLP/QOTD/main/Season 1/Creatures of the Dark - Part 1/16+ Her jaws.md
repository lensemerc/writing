_She couldn't finish the sentence, her body overcome with feelings she could not explain, nor could she do anything as the queen sunk her teeth into her skin._

*The teeth did not gone far. Chrysalis restrained herself. Her eyes flared in contained amusement, as she looked at Celestia from down below. She drew blood from the alicorn, though.*

*Slowly, more smearing it than collecting, she licked on the blood, then licked her own lips.* "

There was a long pregnant pause, when Chrysalis just stared at Celestia. Slowly, the Queen's gaze was becoming more and more hungry.

"I want to eat you, Celestia." She suddenly uttered, and then her muzzle broke into a toothy grin. Her voice, breathy, low and seductive, filled the room. She took a shambling step closer.
"Yessss... I want to tear you to pieces, devour you down to the last bite. To taste your sweat. To hear your screams. I despise you so much... All of you. Everything about you."

"I want to suck down on your marrow, and make you watch... I want to indulge in all kinds of debauchery, to hoard every last bit of your light in myself. To drag you down into deepest black caverns, and not let anyone else ever see you again. I want to [b]do[/b] things to you that you cannot possibly imagine, and it [b]still[/b] would be just a shadow of decadence that we can enact." Her greedy hooves tore into her coat, "I want to [b]burn[/b] and be [b]burned[/b]. To feel alive." 

I can smell the blood on you from here, Celestia.

"I want so many things, every last [b]one[/b] of them, every[b]thing[/b] at once, that I can't help but ask: what do [b]you[/b] want? Is there anything that [b]you[/b] desire? Anything at all?"

Celestia slowly exhaled, steadying her feelings.

"You know what I want, [i]beast[/i]."

Chrysalis : "Don't keep me waiting."

It was like a play that they wanted to enact.

ЧУВСТВО ЭПИКА И ГРУСТИ

"Let's burn together."

Fear... lust... hatred... affection... Celestia's feelings were a mess. 

_The changeling queen was speaking in a feverish, excited, almost deranged manner, and it seemed like her voice, her tone of voice, was changing with every word that she spoke._

"I am the fire," 
"WE are the fire!"


"How I can be beaten,"

"You lack grace. You lack precision."



Led by a strange compultion, Celestia touched her wound in an elegant, precise motion, and stared at her own blood. It looked oddly bright on the alabaster and golden of her hoof.  

"Has anyone ever drew your blood in all of your long existence?" The Queen asked in low tone, hushed and intimate, "I wonder, had you been actually hurt, my precious, untouchable pony Princess?" 

"I was," Celestia replied calmly, listening to how her heartbeat becoming faster and faster, "Yes." 

The sight of her blood though? That was different. 

"What do you feel when you watch your immortal blood ebb away?"

"Fear." Celestia responded ever calmer.

It was so unusual, to fear death, to fear for [i]herself[/i]. She savored the sensation, known to her but almost forgotten, and starkly looked at the changeling Queen. 

The Queen was elated. Her wings buzzed, as she was slowly stepping away from the crumbling rubble.

Her voice rang with echo: "Fear... Do you truly feel it? [b]Fear[/b] is unknown... Fear is [b]ambiguity[/b]... Fear is wonderful!"

Celestia wanted to fight her for real now. Not to go through motions, not to be engaged in some vague combat, not to act out battle that can end only in one way. She wanted to feel all the same that the Queen felt: passion, even [i]love[/i] for fear, [i]love[/i] for life. This thrill...

"Are you creature of fear, Chrysalis?" Celestia smirked, walking towards her.

The changeling wan't answering, grinning, as they began to move against one another in circle, leaving fiery hoofprints in their stride. Celestia's smirk creased into a full-blown smile.


she was speaking slowly, with an echoing growl behind her arrogant and cutting voice

Not like that. Not with that [i]want[/i] and [i]need[/i]. 

""


Her movements were fluid and graceful, yet also powerful and precise.

Celestia closed eyes, feeling how changelings' teeth scraped her neck, moving lower to chest. A primal part of the alicorn Princess was responding to it, agitation was spreading with goosebumps on her coat. 

"I want to burn the whole world for [b]you[/b], Celestia."

I will burn-...

-the whole world...-

-for YOU.

Сражение с пова Луны, Старлайт и Старсвирла

They moved against each other, then clashed with frightening power with their horns. В воздухе, посередине башни, сталкиваются рогами

Потрепанная Целестия выходит из дыма. Луна подбегает к ней с облегчением

Sister, you're fine! (в её витеватом викторианском стиле)

Luna, have I ever told you, how much I love you?

Seriously, I love you [i]a lot[/i].

My dearest little Sister...

You should get out of here, Sister.

You should run, Sister...

Больше и больше Целестий выходит из тумана. Одна из них кусает Луну за muscular rump. "Sorry, I just couldn't [b]contain[/b] myself..." 

"Hey, Beard, "

И потом уже они такие: "I'm surprised you're played along."
"I wanted them to get from here just as you did."
