Her skin was like suede, smooth and tempting. 

Chrysalis locked forelegs on the alicorn's neck, pulling herself closer, pushing chests. Celestia felt the urge to give into the temptation. She wanted the kiss. That damn changeling [i]saliva[/i], she recognized—the secretion in Chrysalis' mouth was like a drug, and it was addictive.


*Princess Celestia could see in the dim light exactly how the changeling queen moved. It was with a certain grace that was both intimidating and attractive at the same time. Her footsteps were quiet, even though at the same time, they also felt like an inevitable approach of something that might cause a major change.*

"My lovely Queen Chrysalis! You look ravishing today.." *She said with a soft, warm smile.*

"What are you doing here in my chambers?"

"I want to **taste** you... **Inhale** you... I **need** you. I **crave** you."


"Your calmness and firmness do not impress me, mare," she smirked, "I can hear how your heart beats, you know. I see that your pupils are dilated in arousal. I can sense your smell, how it spiked now with all kinds of flavors. Ah, you shifting your hooves, there..." She giggled, "Am I getting under your skin?"

""

Kiss my on my hoof and pledge your loyalty to me


Knees buckle from peer preshure


"Do you remember how I humiliated and destroyed you at the wedding of your niece, in front of all your pesky subjects? How I cast down the myth of infallible Sun, and shown them that you're mortal, that you too can bleed and suffer... That even **you** have limits... Even Celestia **herself**..." She growled, keeping going on and licking more feverishly by the second, "Tonight I will do it all over again, my Princess... I will defeat you!"


"Have you ever been in the dark forest, Celestia?" 
"Where nothing is real?"

Попадает в паутину, растянутую между зданиями




"It's no longer about [b]control[/b] or [b]domination[/b]. It is just me wanting to fight you. Don't you?"

Celestia was silent.

"Do you feel alive? This ache in your muscles, this smell of brimstone in your nostrils... The sounds, the [b]effort[/b]..."

"Don't act like "


"Had you ever felt the weight of responsibility, Chrysalis? Do you ever acted like the Queen, not mimicking one?"


fierce changeling Queen
 
Про то как Кризалис пытается соблазнить Целестию, и та успешно сопротивляется

Затем кусает её, и пошло слизывает кровь с копыта Целестии

Sprawled against the breast of the mountain


Do you feel it? Forbidden, and yet tantalizing...

"I don't need them. You are everything that I will ever need.  Powerful you. Forever you. Only you."

What's hotter and more dangerous than the Sun itself?

"Am I getting under your skin, alicorn Princess? Do you feel it? The [b]heat?[/b]"


"My alicorn... my eternal sun..."

Chrysalis mumbled, leaning forward.

"I am just so **parched**..."

Пробивает копытами грудь Кризалис и gasped от неожиданности

Such fervor... она шипит, расползаясь червями, скорпионами, и пауками. Целестия видит что 

Целестия поднимает голову и видит её множество отражений в стеклах. Сияющие зеленые глаза

Затем вздымается черный смерч, и она появляется на вершине дома

"Mare of my dreams."




"I do not seek to suffer, so my emotions must be cast aside."

"You are a liar, Chrysalis. You are all emotions. You said so yourself. Suffering is inevitable even for someone like you."

Chrysalis stopped, and exhaled. Her eyes flared like burning embers, but voice remained cold, full of suppressed rage: "...I hate you."


Преследует Королеву, попадает в паучью паутину, выжигает все вокруг, включая пауков Зрачки Кризалис сужаются когда они сталкиваются Она превращается в дракона, они борятся пламенем. Целестия метает меч в её глотку, призывает другой, пронзает её грудь. Кризалис падает, перевоплощаясь. Когда она под Целестией, пинает её в живот. You dare!

Превращается в паука
В дракона
В рой насекомых
Вызывает своих чейнджлингов и те превращаются в пауков тоже

Целестия зажигает свой рог, ослепляя их всех


"Stop hating ponies. What do you even have beyond that?"
"Don't you **dare** speak like that to me!"
"Here it is again. All ego and wounded pride, and malice. I will never allow such scornful creature near me."


_She couldn't finish the sentence, her body overcome with feelings she could not explain, nor could she do anything as the queen sunk her teeth into her skin._

*The teeth did not gone far. Chrysalis restrained herself. Her eyes flared in contained amusement, as she looked at Celestia from down below. She drew blood from the alicorn, though.*

*Slowly, more smearing it than collecting, she licked on the blood, then licked her own lips.* "

There was a long pregnant pause, when Chrysalis just stared at Celestia. Slowly, the Queen's gaze was becoming more and more hungry.

"I want to eat you, Celestia." She suddenly uttered, and then her muzzle broke into a toothy grin. Her voice, breathy, low and seductive, filled the room. She took a shambling step closer.
"Yessss... I want to tear you to pieces, devour you down to the last bite. To taste your sweat. To hear your screams. I despise you so much... All of you. Everything about you."

"I want to indulge in all kinds of debauchery, to hoard every last bit of your light in myself. To drag you down into deepest black caverns, and not let anyone else ever see you again. I want to [b]do[/b] things to you that you cannot possibly imagine, and it [b]still[/b] would be just a shadow of decadence that we can enact." Her greedy hooves tore into her coat, "I want to [b]burn[/b] and be [b]burned[/b]. To feel alive." 

I can smell the blood on you from here, Celestia.

I want to suck down on your marrow, and make you watch... 


She craved a kiss. The Queen's vile saliva was [i]addictive[/i]. Chrysalis was literally like a drug, and she knew it perfectly, she [i]knew[/i] how to play into it.

Кризалис в отражениях



"I want so many things, every last [b]one[/b] of them, every[b]thing[/b] at once, that I can't help but ask: what do [b]you[/b] want? Is there anything that [b]you[/b] desire? Anything at all?"

Celestia slowly exhaled, steadying her feelings.

"You know what I want, [i]beast[/i]."

Chrysalis : "Don't keep me waiting."

It was like a play that they wanted to enact.

ЧУВСТВО ЭПИКА И ГРУСТИ

Про то как она вспрыгивает на балкон, и её последующий спиц

"Let's burn together."

Fear... lust... hatred... affection... Celestia's feelings were a mess. 

_The changeling queen was speaking in a feverish, excited, almost deranged manner, and it seemed like her voice, her tone of voice, was changing with every word that she spoke._

"I am the fire," 
"WE are the fire!"


"How I can be beaten,"

"You lack grace. You lack precision."








Led by a strange compultion, Celestia touched her wound in an elegant, precise motion, and stared at her own blood. It looked oddly bright on the alabaster and golden of her hoof.  

"Has anyone ever drew your blood in all of your long existence?" The Queen asked in low tone, hushed and intimate, "I wonder, had you been actually hurt, my precious, untouchable pony Princess?" 

"I was," Celestia replied calmly, listening to how her heartbeat becoming faster and faster, "Yes." 

The sight of her blood though? That was different. 

"What do you feel when you watch your immortal blood ebb away?"

"Fear." Celestia responded ever calmer.

It was so unusual, to fear death, to fear for [i]herself[/i]. She savored the sensation, known to her but almost forgotten. 

The Queen was elated. Her wings buzzed, as she was slowly stepping away from the crumbling rubble. Her voice rang with echo: "Fear... Do you truly feel it? The unknown... The [b]ambiguity[/b]... Fear is wonderful..."

Celestia wanted to fight her for real now. Not to go through motions, not to be engaged in some vague combat, not to act out battle that can end only in one way. She wanted to feel all the same that the Queen felt: passion and [i]love[/i] for fear, [i]love[/i] for life. This thrill...

"Are you creature of fear, Chrysalis?" Celestia smirked, walking towards her.

The changeling wan't answering, grinning, as they began to move against one another in circle, leaving fiery hoofprints in their stride. Celestia's smirk blossomed into a full-blown smile.


she was speaking slowly, with an echoing growl behind her arrogant and cutting voice

Not like that. Not with that [i]want[/i] and [i]need[/i]. 

""


Her movements were fluid and graceful, yet also powerful and precise.

Celestia closed eyes, feeling how changelings' teeth scraped her neck, moving lower to chest. A primal part of the alicorn Princess was responding to it, agitation was spreading with goosebumps on her coat. 

"I want to burn the whole world for [b]you[/b], Celestia."

Fight scene:
Cockiness
Determination
I will burn-...

-the whole world...-

-for YOU.
Desperation

False finish

gritty, visceral, exhausting battle


Сражение с пова Луны, Старлайт и Старсвирла

They moved against each other, then clashed with frightening power with their horns. В воздухе, посередине башни, сталкиваются рогами

Потрепанная Целестия выходит из дыма. Луна подбегает к ней с облегчением

Sister, you're fine! (в её витеватом викторианском стиле)

Luna, have I ever told you, how much I love you?

Seriously, I love you [i]a lot[/i].

My dearest little Sister...

You should get out of here, Sister.

You should run, Sister...

Больше и больше Целестий выходит из тумана. Одна из них кусает Луну за muscular rump. "Sorry, I just couldn't [b]contain[/b] myself..." 

"Hey, Beard, "

И потом уже они такие: "I'm surprised you're played along."
"I wanted them to get from here just as you did."



Зеленый рог Кризалис светится во тьме, освещая её лицо

Когда она поражает Целестию, та падает на вершину и склон горы, чувствуя боль во всем теле. It was just like the first time she died. She remembered vividly


Their shared fate, their [i]destiny[/i], to be destroyed together.
