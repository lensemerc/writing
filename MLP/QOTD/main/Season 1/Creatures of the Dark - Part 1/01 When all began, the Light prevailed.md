[i][size=1.2em][b]ℌ[/b]𝖊[/size] broke the tether; [size=1.2em]𝖍𝖊[/size]'s confound.
Forevermore, they are still bound.
All that [size=1.2em]𝖍𝖊[/size] mustered was in vain,
In dimmed darkness, there's a chain.

A regal moon in night shines bright,
Her purposes affront [size=1.2em]𝖍𝖎𝖘[/size] sight.
A summer sun rose high, glared down, 
Her fate entwined, she wears the gown. 

All not for naught, [size=1.2em]𝖍𝖊[/size] isn't swayed, 
In frozen cold there's a shade.
Despair and promise—there's the deal, 
A wayward child imprints the seal.

Rebellious thoughts born out of malice, 
The status quo upsets the balance,
Three moving toward the Dark sublime, 
Envisioned futures tear down the time.[/i]
