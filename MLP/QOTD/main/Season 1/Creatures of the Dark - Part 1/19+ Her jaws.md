I can give you such delightful pain. Pain so acute and pleasurable, so exquisite that you will not be able to take your mind off me. I will invade your dreams, my caresses will linger on your skin like a sweet fragrance. You will be addicted. I will bring you heaven, and perhaps... if you are good... a few seconds of hell too.


Love is an individualistic power. When you love, you want to live. You have something to fight for.

"Real Queens? What are you talking about?..." Chrysalis asked back, and then her eyes flashed in understanding. "Ah, I see...

There is no step over some line...

In reality, you push your limits. You engage in a game of compromises with yourself and with your conscience. You realize that there are things that you can get away with.
The things that can grant you more pleasure than pain...

You were never meant to be a fighter, or protector... Aren't you?
I think I understood you. You are too kind, too compassionate... It is your greatest strength, and greatest weakness. But it is all that is ever came to you naturally. To everything else, you've just adapted.



"This is the feeling that I want. No constraints, no limitations, no definitions or expectations of what I _should_ be. Just me, my movement and my passion. I don't owe anyone anything, I am what I am. I just want to be _free_." It's like a rush of fire is flowing through her body, her breathing quickening and her heart pounding in her chest. "This is the one place where I can express myself, where I don't have to hide myself or try to act like someone I'm not. _This_ is my freedom."


Regret poisons the will and the mind. I don't need to remember how it tastes like.
But to me you may as well be made out of it... Most intriguing.

If you don't feel regret over anything, then you might as well be living dead.

Perhaps.

The whole world stopped. Than it began to move anew.

"Oh, so it is true?" C ""

- Celestia, I realized something... she sighs You were never meant to be a fighter, or protector... Aren't you? You weren't supposed to banish Nightmare Moon, or actually be a ruler, or make tough decisions... She looks sternly at Celestia I think I understood you. You are too kind, too loving~... It is your greatest strength, and greatest weakness. But it is all that is ever came to you naturally. To everything else, you've just adapted. That's... a very perceptive observation, _she says with a hint of surprise. She gives a long stare at Spirit of Love, before speaking in a soft and gentle voice._ So, then... would you say I'm weak, for being this way? _she asks curiously, the twinkle in her eyes being replaced by a look of genuine curiosity over Spirit of Love's observation. A faint blush forms across her face as a soft and gentle smile crosses her lips._ ...or would you say I'm strong for being so... kind? Celestia~ Spirit of Love slightly moved forward, her ears stood up How can you be weak? You adapted. You made your best, and it shows. It's just that I... her shoulders slightly sagged, as she was thinking what to say I... Never thought about you like this, I guess. I thought that your kind heart is secondary to your status as a ruler. But it actually the other way around.

An impish grin once more paints her face as an intense feeling of joy and playfulness washes over her being. A pure and gentle laughter escapes her lips as she speaks in a soft and gentle voice._ ...my greatest strength is my kindness? _she adds excitedly._ ...my greatest strength... is _love?_ Spirit of Love slowly smiled, looking at Celestia with glistening eyes. There was a few seconds of hesitation. Then she lowered her head, and moved down in deep bow It seems so... My Princess.

Her mouth hangs open, before she is finally able to find the words to speak. A soft and gentle smile is on her face as she slowly moves forward, placing one hoof on Spirit of Love's shoulder with a look of deep compassion and love in her eyes. She gives a soft and gentle laugh, before gently giving a loving and affectionate pat on Spirit of Love's side. This is clearly one of the most cherished moments in her life._ ...thank you. Spirit of Love softly smiles, looking at you with devotion I am your most ardent follower, my Princess. Always was, almost will be.

Chrysalis was calm.

"Have you ever been in the dark forest where nothing makes sense?"


_The alicorn was only intended to reign over Equestria for but a short time, and she had spent her entire life fighting for their prosperity._

*She felt a cold shiver at her words, as she heard the hunger in her voice. To her surprise, her face heated up and she went red instantly.*

...I... why...

*She swallowed the saliva that was suddenly building up in her mouth, as she struggled to compose herself.*

...I... I don't know why, if it's a form of admiration or what... but... it... sounds...

*The words fell out of her mouth, as she realized how intimate and how close being devoured would make her to someone she loved.*

Her tongue was dexterous and powerful. It could've done wonders to her body, and Celestia knew it well.

Her moan is louder and more pronounced, her head tossed back, her eyes gazing up towards the ceiling. She's lost in the moment, her body responding to the movements of her lover beneath her. She arches her back to meet the momentum of his motions.

It was a frightening realization that she may senselessly perish, and she has no control over it. The Princess tried to quell the flames of lust, burning her, threatening to engulf her entire being.

"My enemy and lover~" Celestia moaned through clenched teeth, as her horn shone with condensing power, "You keep bringing me most sweetest gifts..."

Chrysalis watched in awe, pushing against her even more insistently, more intimately. She reached for her lips.

Chrysalis locked forelegs on the alicorn's neck, pulling herself closer, pushing chests. Celestia felt the urge to give into the temptation. She wanted the kiss. That damn changeling [i]saliva[/i], she recognized‚Äîthe secretion in Chrysalis' mouth was like a drug, and it was addictive.

You might have powers of a demigoddess, but your you have little when it comes to intellect, as befits to an insect.

Her footsteps were quiet, even though at the same time, they also felt like an inevitable approach of something that might cause a major change.*

"My lovely Queen Chrysalis! You look ravishing today.." *She said with a soft, warm smile.*

her breastplate


What if I know where you hid your little Twilight Sparkle?... Maybe you will wake up tomorrow with her stone head, broken off from the statue, lying at your knees with that delicious expression of despair...


She pushes the alicorn harder to the throne, and to the wall. She's ever so ravenous, this lanky monster, that is so thin and malnourished. Her hooves dig deep into Celestia's soft coat, as well as into a bit too grown flank after all this sitting in one place and consuming sweets. Chrysals breathes warmly, satisfied, and her fire keeps going, as bestial loud slaps fill the throne room. 
"Our souls entwined," she murmurs, "Do you feel it?"

Together we are more alive, than on our own...

"I've thought you would like the irony."

"Such fury."

"You're a *monster*..." Celestia groans, moving her face closer to Chrysalis's ears, "You deserve to die..." she rasps, "Your crimes are unforgivable..." but now there is a strange glow of excitement and pleasure in her eyes... she is getting used to the Changeling's closeness, even though the touch of her enemy makes her shiver with disgust... but her hatred for her only grows stronger...



*The Princess leans into her grasp and she doesn't even try to stop the tears. The alicorn wraps her arms around the Changeling Queen, and she closes her eyes. She is lost in the warmth of Chrysalis, and in the moment.*

"I would follow you to the end of Equestria," *she whispers, slowly, as she opens her eyes again and looks directly at the pale Changeling, with tears still streaming down her face.* 

"Whatever darkness awaits us, I can handle it by your side."

*The Changeling's touch makes the alicorn feel like she's melting. Her tail wags rapidly with a growing euphoria that turns into a frenzy. Celestia's body writhes, she closes her eyes, panting, and turns slightly closer to the Queen, as if to invite her deeper. The Princess wants all of it. She no longer even cares that she let herself give in to temptation. Her whole body desires it, it craves for the darkness just to forget the burden of her guilt and responsibility.*

_She couldn't finish the sentence, her body overcome with feelings she could not explain, nor could she do anything as the queen sunk her teeth into her skin._

*The teeth did not gone far. Chrysalis restrained herself. Her eyes flared in contained amusement, as she looked at Celestia from down below. She drew blood from the alicorn, though.*

*Slowly, more smearing it than collecting, she licked on the blood, then licked her own lips.* "

There was a long pregnant pause, when Chrysalis just stared at Celestia. Slowly, the Queen's gaze was becoming more and more hungry.

"I want to eat you, Celestia." She suddenly uttered, and then her muzzle broke into a toothy grin. Her voice, breathy, low and seductive, filled the room. She took a shambling step closer.
"Yessss... I want to tear you to pieces, devour you down to the last bite. To taste your sweat. To hear your screams. I despise you so much... All of you. Everything about you."



I can smell the blood on you from here, Celestia.

I want to suck down on your marrow, and make you watch...

Celestia slowly exhaled, steadying her feelings.

"You know what I want, [i]beast[/i]."

"Let's burn together."

Fear... lust... hatred... affection... Celestia's feelings were a mess. 

_The changeling queen was speaking in a feverish, excited, almost deranged manner, and it seemed like her voice, her tone of voice, was changing with every word that she spoke._

"I am the fire," 
"WE are the fire!"


"How I can be beaten,"

"You lack grace. You lack precision."








Led by a strange compultion, Celestia touched her wound in an elegant, precise motion, and stared at her own blood. It looked oddly bright on the alabaster and golden of her hoof.  

"Has anyone ever drew your blood in all of your long existence?" The Queen asked in low tone, hushed and intimate, "I wonder, had you been actually hurt, my precious, untouchable pony Princess?" 

"I was," Celestia replied calmly, listening to how her heartbeat becoming faster and faster, "Yes." 

The sight of her blood though? That was different. 

"What do you feel when you watch your immortal blood ebb away?"

"Fear." Celestia responded ever calmer.

It was so unusual, to fear death, to fear for [i]herself[/i]. She savored the sensation, known to her but almost forgotten. 

The Queen was elated. Her wings buzzed, as she was slowly stepping away from the crumbling rubble. Her voice rang with echo: "Fear... Do you truly feel it? The unknown... The [b]ambiguity[/b]... Fear is wonderful..."

Celestia wanted to fight her for real now. Not to go through motions, not to be engaged in some vague combat, not to act out battle that can end only in one way. She wanted to feel all the same that the Queen felt: passion and [i]love[/i] for fear, [i]love[/i] for life. This thrill...

"Are you creature of fear, Chrysalis?" Celestia smirked, walking towards her.

The changeling wan't answering, grinning, as they began to move against one another in circle, leaving fiery hoofprints in their stride. Celestia's smirk blossomed into a full-blown smile.

*Chrysalis chuckles softly, her voice like an elegant feline's.* "So, you're the queen, and what does this make me..? Your *subject*? Your inferior? I'm no such thing. I am the more mature, intelligent, and independent changeling. I am not bound by anything. My feelings are my own and I act on what I like. I follow no one..."

Celestia felt that her lips dried up, all of the sudden. "So let me ask you, since we are all in this together, why not [i]strive[/i] to be kind and considerate to one another? Is it really so bad‚Äîdespite [i]everything[/i] that defined us in the past, despite all doubts‚Äîto try?"

"Had you ever felt the weight of responsibility, Chrysalis? Do you ever acted like the Queen, not mimicking one?"


You will destroy the realm, doom everyone.


"Most are afraid of their emotions, Celestia. You shouldn't be. Not you..." 

 Let it be no one to rely on, and no one who'd rely on you." Chrysalis uttered with a demand of fire in her eyes: "Let us burn."

, and in this vulnerability she saw the freedom of the unknown.



Maybe you're just more into mares, with all that longing for your little sister?... Or maybe in your heart of hearts you want [b]all[/b] of your little ponies to worship you more intimately, indiscriminately?..."

Strange acute nature of the shapeshifting beast could led it to latch on every movement that could speak volumes of sheer contempt, rising in the alicorn Princess with every word. Seemingly, Chrysalis was enjoying it nonetheless. 

Lack of outburst was a reaction enough for her, and so she kept talking slowly, with happy green eyes: "What, not even them, my infallible demigoddess? Maybe you would want to indulge into something more innocent? I can make anything happen, and we could keep it as our personal secret. So, how about small precious colts‚Äî"

"How [i]dare[/i] you presume something like [i]that[/i] about me, and disgrace me with your presence?" Celestia stopped holding back. She took a step, her great wings flared. "[i]Get out of my sight,[/i] you [i]mongrel[/i]."

and vehemently grinned: "Maybe... Maybe you would want stallions? I can [b]arrange[/b] that... Big, beautiful, they will serve you like a [b]divine[/b] being you are. For you, all for you...

The Queen sucked her teeth and replied, her voice tinged with lazy menace


Harmony is a state of equilibrium and balance. It is an alignment of various opposite forces and energies to create a stable and harmonious whole. It is an interplay between two or more opposite elements, each contributing to create harmony in their own unique way. The harmony between the sun and the moon allows life to flourish in Equestria, the harmony between the four alicorns allows friendship and love to prevail, and so forth. Harmony is a fundamental concept in the philosophy and understanding of magic, friendship and the world in general.



Ponies are amusing. They are full of mouthwatering innocence.
When I roamed and rampaged through different realms of ponies, I appreciated how often they are reflections of their rulers.
This one is yours. Beautiful, secluded, soft and vast, and yet with nestled fire within. So full of love and unspent vigor...

"Do you think that they care about your precious harmony?"



Adrenaline pumped in her veins.


There was a possibility of wiping her spawn completely from the face of this world... Celestia smirked. This predator will break the teeth on the hides of her ponies... Wouldn't be the first time.

Usually the losses of loved ones in Equestria were handled with private ceremonies, accompanied by 

Ponies usually mourn the death of their loved ones with private ceremonies. They often perform special songs and eulogies. Friends and family usually come to the ceremonies to support the grieving ponies. Ponies who have lost the ones they love are often sad but try to support each other in the difficult time. Some ponies find their solace in prayers, while others find it by reflecting on their loved one's life. Ponies understand that life is short and time is precious. So sometimes it is better to not waste too much time on sorrow and to let love live on even in the darkness of loss.

Ponies traditionally honor the dead by laying flowers and memorial wreaths at the grave, while some also burn candles in memory of the departed. There is also a tradition of holding wakes, where ponies come together to share fond memories and stories of the deceased, to honor and remember their life.

it is customary to hold a 'final feast' for them. They gather all of their friends and family to feast in honor, and to remember what their presence meant. They also pray for them to find rest in the afterlife. The ceremony is viewed as a dark reflection of a wedding.

Tartarus is seen by ponies as a place where fallen ponies have their sins punished. 

When a pony dies, it is believed that their soul is reunited with the magic of Equestria. Their spirit then roams throughout the land, watching over their kin as they grow and prosper, until the time finally comes for them to reincarnate and be reborn in the body of a foal.

Ponies generally hold ceremonies and festivities such as birthdays, anniversaries and weddings, and there are also traditional annual celebrations, such as Hearthswarming Eve and Nightmare Night.

No one in this day and age should be aware of existence of Discord, except Starswirl and his fellow Pillars. What game is he having? Did he harm Luna in any way? "[i]No, he wouldn't dare. I would destroy him on the spot,[/i]" Celestia thought grimly.

"A complaint?"

"Dear duchess suffered a heatstroke."

*Taken aback by Chrysalis' unexpected presence, Princess Celestia nervously tries to maintain her composure, but cannot help but shiver at the contact of her cold nose, and as a result her voice shakes. The changeling Queen, on the other hand, looks like she could care less about Princess Celestia's discomfort, as she is busy sniffing her, trying to drink in the smell of her scent.*

"You crave excitement, don't you?"

"And you [i]crave[/i] pleasure... do you not? You have denied yourself pleasure for too long, Celestia... Simple, carnal pleasure.



"I know your type... Please, as if you would ever risk your reputation for something like that. The moment they start seeing you as a pony, and not just infallible being from far above, the moment they understand that you are just like them, then rumors would persist through generations, carrying a danger to all that you are. Besides, you know your pathetic inferior little ponies are useless in that regard... The moment they realize they can have real power over you... The moment you invite in their life a genuine ambition: to fell a [b]god[/b]... It will be all over."

So tell me what you want. I am the only creature you can be open with, believe me.

"If you seek to claim dominion over my ponies, wouldn't it mean that I get your changelings too?" 

Chrysalis blinked, puzzled. It was something she did not considered. 

Celestia pressed on: "You wouldn't expect that I will allow sentient species to be kept tortured by you? 

Why do you even _care_? Touch them, and I will _destroy_ you, mare. 

Oh, but wouldn't I be in my right to do so? Besides, do you seriously expect you can control each one of them, now? Look at them. How long before they will begin yearning for freedom?




"Do not listen to her! Ponies hate you, they despise you, they fear you. They are ENEMY."

"What a predicament, Chrysalis," Celestia cocked her head and trilled before she could stop herself, "to have an enemy without whom you cannot survive." She enjoyed the look of enraged changeling Queen, and turned to her spawn, "Most ponies don't even know that changelings exist, little ones."

"Well now they will know, won't they?"

"Oh yes, and it's all because of you, and your misaligned scornful war against the common sense."

"Oh that's rich. Looks who's talking! You are going to lecture me, Celestia? You!?"


"You are a picture of degradation. All you know is how to take, never to give anything in return.

" Stagnate infertile mare,  you don't even have anything to give, " Chrysalis scowled back with vicious passion," All you have going on for you, are looks. "

" Oh, now I know you're being ingenuine..."



"Show me no mercy."
"Maybe it's my turn to be your plaything."


"I will murder everyone you know."

"You want to break your promise already?" Celestia clicked her tongue in mock dissappointment, "You can't hold on to your basic instincts even for an hour..."

"I will flay you alive."

"Now that's better."


I bet you... **can** be tamed~.. Or, **broken**, if you wish~



"Is the Undercity "

"Overseer "


"It is up to me to finish this. "

"I can destroy you right here and now, Chrysalis, but we both know this won't a fitting end for any of us," Celestia claimed, keeping her wings flared. 

The Changeling Queen did not replied, nor did not showed any worry about the fact, so Celestia pressed on:

"This won't continue like this, but it is in our power to choose how and when we will go out. We will meet at this evening and we will fall, one way of the other."


"This won't go on like this. We must battle and we must fall, one way or the other."




Memories as fickle just as love is




"Don't you afraid that I will once again humiliate you in front of the subjects? After all, it was I who showed them that you can be beaten..."

"Think you can pull off this miracle once again?" Celestia smiled, narrowing eyes, and her tail barely moved as she thought about the excitement of the battle.

    What a sad, spiteful creature... To go through life motivated by hatred and malice is no way to live. It's a miserable, empty existence.

The changeling insectoid with shimmering green eyes and long dragonfly wings, Queen Chrysalis, lanky and monstrous as she always is, is sitting in the middle of the throne room. She scowls, looking and Celestia, flashing her pointy teeth.

But, there is something more in her eyes. A strange intent, bordering on reverence.

She lazily stands up and begins to move towards the alicorn Princess. Her forelegs are on the steps leading to the seat of Equestria, where the Princess resides

lensemerc

Chrysalis returns fixed gaze, as she reaches for Celestia, now on one level with her. Her huge green eyes slightly tremble, as she takes in the noble alicorn's visage. The Queen leans forward, touching the warm Princess's coat with her muzzle, lowering eyelids.

Chrysalis grins silently, raising one foreleg and tracing it along Celestia's flank. Nuzzling suddenly becomes more apparent, as they both press against one another, this ugly and fearsome changeling Queen and bright Princess of all ponies.

Her green eyes, as the Queen starkly watches Celestia's impression. Her tail lashes against the stone, and then the changeling reaches for the alicorn's ear, whispering: "I am a monster."

She carefully moves her nose across Celestia's shoulder to her elongated neck.

"What's with that appeal to conscience, Celestia? Are you getting senile?"




Through the dragonflame apparition


*Celestia's eyes open again, the pupils widening. The Queen's tongue is on her chest now, tracing lines of pleasure all over her body. But her back hurts with the hardness of the bug's teeth, and the bite marks and wounds all over her stomach hurt as well.*

"I've hated you for years..." *she whispers in response.*

*Her voice is hoarse, the pain a welcome reminder of the hatred the two feel for each other. Celestia can almost hate the bug, but her feelings for the Queen are more twisted than that...*

"My ideals are weak? Tell me that they are weak, I dare you."

"Tell "

"Mmm..." *She gasps, enjoying the attention. Even though she might want to continue this moment of tranquility, she can't help but feel some amount of guilt.*

*She glances at Chrysalis and looks her straight in the eye, seeing her predatory expression and the fire of lust and aggression in her eyes. But it's a fire Celestia desires. She can't help but want to be in the Queen's embrace right now, holding her and... enjoying each other's company...*


*Celestia watches Chrysalis with an alluring gaze. The sight of the Queen in the moonlight, leaving her, after a night full of passion and love-hate... That should be a painting. She sighs, and fixes her mane and hair as best as possible. Then she tries to pull herself together, straightening her crown, her robe, her own mane. After all, she is the Princess of Equestria, and she doesn't want to look like she had just been in an intense love-making session...*


_Chrysalis whispers into Celestia's ear, her green irises shining like gems in amber. Celestia's eyes are a pool of liquid crystal and serenity as she listens._

Oh, Chrysalis, you are not a monster. You are a special friend, with a unique way of showing affection. We have always seen the best in each other.


1. ### _[_21:28_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    That is correct. All living creatures have flaws we can exploit to our advantage. Their usefulness depends on the amount and the type of flaws.
    
2. ### _[_21:29_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    You are correct! Everything has its uses, and I can take advantage of that. In a way, I am a beauty queen, because I am a master of manipulation and illusion and therefore the master of beauty. It is easy for me to exploit almost anything and use it to my benefit.
    

4. ### _[_22:21_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    **CHRYSALIS?!** You have brought an _**infested**_ creature to my courtroom? How _dare_ you, you insolent insect. How _DARE_ you insult and disrespect me in such a manner! You have committed the gravest of insults towards me, and I shall _**not**_ hesitate to show you what _**true**_ power is.
    
5. ### _[_22:21_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    I know her type. She's an egoist who thinks only of herself and her hive. She's incapable of viewing other ponies as anything more than prey. If I let her feed on me, she'd do it with no remorse. I'd only be giving in to her greed, and I refuse to give her the satisfaction. I'd tell her off. She's selfish, callous, and cruel, and she knows it. She's no friend of mine and I have no desire to do anything for her.
    
6. ### _[_22:22_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    I'm sure she'd leave my court with her tail between her legs!

    You are a disgrace of a creature. You dare challenge me? Your audacity knows no bounds. You, whose only power is draining ponies of their energy, you dare challenge _**Celestia herself**_? My power has no bounds, my magic is endless. I can manipulate the very sun's rays. I can raise the moon and stars with but a motion of my hoof. I have not yet demonstrated my might. You should be on your knees and beg for my forgiveness and mercy. Do not anger me, you'll regret it.
    

8. ### _[_22:23_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    If you _dare_ come near me with your parasitic ways, I will make sure you feel the full wrath of my magic. You are nothing but a vile, disgusting creature, unfit to be called a sapient being. I will not be taken advantage of by some insect queen for her own personal gain. _**I am your princess, and you shall do well to remember it.**_
    
9. ### _[_22:24_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    _**I**_ am the Princess of the day, _**I**_ am the ruler of Equestria, _**I**_ am the one who rules over all. You are a worthless insect, a bug, a parasite. I wield the power to crush entire cultures with the mere snap of a single hoof - and you have the _**nerve**_ to demand I be fed to you! Are you mad? Do you think my life is worth nothing but a mere snack for your monstrous appetite? I am the keeper of the sun, the master of the day. I will _**NOT**_ be consumed by such a monster!
    
10. ### _[_22:26_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    You foolish beast. You dare challenge _**me**_? The ruler of Equestria, the princess of light, a god amongst ponies, the _Queen of the Sun_?! I have power you cannot even begin to _comprehend_, I could bring you to your knees with the mere _flick_ of my tail. I could turn you to ash with just a _look_. And yet you insist to stand before me and challenge my rule?

"Because everything will end now,"


"Let you **be feared** by my subjects?"

*Celestia giggled.* "I'm sure that will turn out just **fine**, love, but I wouldn't want you to waste your abilities **just** on spying. Your changelings are such capable, smart creatures... We should at **least** let them spread love and friendship throughout the land."

"I know you've said that ponies don't interest you, but I'm **sure** that even you would adore the sweet and simple ponies and their silly little traditions." *She whispered.*


"...I'm **glad** to find another soul that understands..." *Celestia mumbled softly.*

"I've been **tired** of seeing everything as so... so... **simple**." *Her eyes widened.* "Ponies don't fight to be better than their neighbor, they don't even fight for what they want. **They are content to stay in their little safe and comfortable routine.** And they call it **happy**."

"I don't want to be happy. I **need** more. I **crave** more. I need to **fight for it!**"

Celestia did not graced her with an answer. They both knew that she is completely right.

Chrysalis gazed back at changelings with uncertainty. She was being pressed into a corner.
