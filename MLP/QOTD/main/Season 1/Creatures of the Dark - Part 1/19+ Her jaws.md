íÑà "[b][size=1.1em]O[/size][/b]ur souls are entwined," Chrysalis breathlessly whispered. "Can you feel it?"

Celestia bent under the changelings' assault. Chrysalis pinned her to the wall. She let it happen.

"Tread lightly, beast. You speak of a kinship with the star," Celestia warned in an equally quiet voice.

"The [i]star[/i]?" Chrysalis sneered defiantly. "All the stars are far in the sky, and they have conspired to bring us together. In another place, in another time, we would've never met like this."

"The stars might seem far, but they still watch over all," Celestia breathed out and crossed her forehooves on Chrysalis' nape.

Why does it always feels as if the Dark is stronger? 

"Must be so lonely‚Äîto be the most powerful being in existence," Chrysalis tempted.

"In this world‚Äî" The touch of her enemy made Celestia sharply inhale and fill her lungs with an acrid smell, mixed with the sweet odor of ozone. In a futile attempt to restrain herself, she pushed her knees together. 

Why does nothing ever goes according to plan?

"You shouldn't be afraid of your emotions. Not [b]you[/b]," Chrysalis snarled.

"Foolish [i]insect[/i]." Celestia's lip curled in a grimace. 

They were going down the lust-filled river of darkness that was stirring inside of them both. Chrysalis' forehooves dug into the alicorn's coat, virtuously directing the rafting.

"You're a [i]monster[/i]..." Celestia groaned and rasped into Chrysalis' ear. "You [i]deserve[/i] to die. Your crimes are [i]unforgivable[/i]."

The Queen bared her teeth, satisfied. She loved it. They both did.

...And there was a constant fight against jealousy, avarice, pride, and addiction. A fight against emotions that run amok.

There was a [i]pull[/i].

And there are never any steps over the lines, and no imaginary boundaries. All there was is an arrival at what was perceived before as a limit, and then an engagement in a game of compromises with your conscience. 

There was a revelation that things exist that you can get away with, the things, that can grant you more pleasure than pain... Isn't it natural to try to diminish your pain, and if you care about someone, to diminish pain of another too?

And there comes a [i]push[/i].

"I want to learn all your curves," murmured Chrysalis. "Maybe what you want is to be worshiped?"

"Trespasser-r..." Celestia hissed, her voice is almost ecstatic. "You think you can take and break anything you want!?"

"I want only your heart. Give it to me. I'll rip it out." Chrysalis' eyes gleamed with virile green. "I want all your resolve, your [i]every[/i] emotion. [b]Pour[/b] it [b]all[/b] out."

Behind her thinly veiled prideful arrogance was boundless confidence, based on something beyond any juvenile sense of entitlement. Chrysalis [i]knew[/i] she was good because she [i]was[/i] good. It was her craft, her lifeblood. Celestia [i]knew[/i] that the nature of the Queen's powers demanded to submit to her willingly.

They both were aware of how it was supposed to end... So why not enjoy it a while longer? Celestia gave into the meticulous caress of the changeling's aura at the base of her wings. She wanted more, and she expanded them in full, taking over the room with bright light. She arched her back with a smile full of pained bliss. Chrysalis was hitting all the right spots.

Celestia wanted for her body to be used like a delicate instrument that it was. It wasn't [i]truly[/i] built for fighting, after all.

"You trifle with the Sun itself," she warned weakly, nonetheless.

"My sopping [b]wet[/b] Sun," Chrysalis replied in the most haunting and beautiful of voices.

Her skin was like suede, smooth and tempting. Celestia moved her forehooves lower, and the excited Queen eagerly leaned into the soft embrace.

"I admire your bold spirit," confessed Celestia. "To defy me on every turn, but still be willing to play with me... You are a creature that is full of courage and hubris."

As if in drunken stupor, they forced their bodies together.

"My [b]playmate[/b]," Chrysalis vigorously snarled. "I [b]love[/b] it. Don't you afraid that I will play too rough and break you?"

"You mean to say, [i]you're[/i] afraid of that?" Celestia nickered.

"No..." the ancient shapeshifter bit back a growing smile. "No, I [i]want[/i] to [b]tear you apart.[/b]" 

A rush of pleasant shivers ran down Celestia's coat. 

"I want to mix your flesh with mine, so let there be no [i]me[/i], nor [i]you[/i]..." Chrysalis sang with vicious, raw lust. "I want to peel your bones bare clean... I want to break those bones and suck on your marrow... I want to. I [b][i]want[/b][/i] to..."

These voracious words enticed her. The Queen slipped past all defenses and inhibitors; her touch managed to pull from the alicorn an immodestly loud moan.

"[i]This is madness,[/i]" flashed a fading thought.

Chrysalis buried her muzzle into Celestia's neck, greedily breathing in her scent. Her warm whisper filled her world, "I want to show you what [b]true[/b] admiration [b]is[/b]. There's [b]nothing[/b] more intimate than to become [b]one[/b] with the other."

"You got it all wrong, you foolish changeling..." Slick with sweat, panting, Celestia covered her enemy with her wings. "That is [i]such[/i] a one-sided point of view..."

"And yet you are aware that there's truth in it," replied Chrysalis with flirtatious malice. 

"Why everything must be about conflict and domination with you?"

"Because it is all about [b]power[/b]." Chrysalis began with ominous voice.

The teetering on the edge of the sensual abyss.

"[i]How strange it is: in the end, I do not want to be hurt. This dark, carnal heat feels so good... I want for this to last forever.[/i]"

She knew that she could die at any moment now. 

The possibility of her demise wasn't something that was often on her mind, and it was so unusual to face it... She savored the sensation, known to her but almost forgotten. 

When Chrysalis' teeth pierced her skin, she shuddered with a quiet gasp.

It was a frightening realization that she may senselessly perish, and she has no control over it.

Let out flames devour one another. 
There are no better way to settle our ancient rivalry.
I know that your heart calls out to do this...

"You aren't a rival. You are a parasite who hurt my little Sister."

"You speak and I hear the ripples on water that try to describe what water is."

"All is fine and well in the Kingdom of the Sun,-" began Celestia, not breaking her gait.

"An ash, dreaming of wind."

Her forehoof went along her royal scepter, fashioned from her own bone and flesh ages ago. A lithe, beautiful thing it was, wreathed in a liquid flame and

"You should've sprouted roots."

"Dissention invite hate, and how long can hate hold everything together?"

"Bah. I can feel you," Vorak growled. "If I could take back the time, I'd never sired any of the little bastards."

"That is a fool's talk," Celestia replied evenly. "You love them."

"Aye, that might be true. However, all of them are backstabbing, sniveling unruly cretins, and before you ask, yes‚Äîeven my golden boy Scorpan is not without a sin."

"Truly, your opinion of your kin is always so low," Celestia spoke

"You would've known too the joys of having a huge family instead of surrounding yourself with ponies.

Celestia's ear flickered. "I am not a matron material, I'm afraid."

Your oven is too hot to bake children, no matter how many times you might've tried."

"Dearest Cousin, you are forgetting yourself. I am a Princess, a mare, and a lady. There are not enough ladies around your court, is there?"

"Ha!" Vorak brayed. "Right now you are as much a woman as a pig with a horn is a unicorn. You're one of [i]us[/i], Cousin, and I will speak with you like an equal, whether you like it or not."

"Is that why you bring that stick each time we meet?" 

"It is my show of respect."

"You didn't even flinched when you said it." 
"Be serious, now. "
"You are terrified of this, don't you? In your heart of hearts you often dreamed about how you might bring down mighty Celestia, to engrave your name in the legends for [i][color=#FAC18A]eternity[/color][/i] to come, and to find out if this celestial mare piss and shits herself when she dies just like any other."

He laughed, and Celestia 

"We might've been fine enemies, but that is not in our destinies. I'd drink to that.  "

Celestia watched how the ancient's warlock-king jugular worked as he gorged himself on the wine. 

Celestia regarded the ancient warlock-king. "[i]Prepared speeches for assemblies and for lobbies are always different.[/i]" She wanted to get back to familiar Equestria already. 

"Next thing you'd tell me that millenium ago your firstborn just [i]happened[/i] to slip past your fingers and to invade Equestria. I don't like to be used in someone's machinations."

"It pleases me to see that you aren't so stiff as you appear to be. It's almost -- what is the word? "

"Oak-King, you are the last of all living creatures who should try to provoke me."

"When did you became so stiff?"
"Soon is the time to fetch that little sister of yours. "
"We throw such great feasts at Summer Sun Celebration and your kind never comes. You'd think the Mare of the Dreams would change the stale things a little. At least it would be fine to see dreams again."
"I don't even remember how she looked like --at least not before she became a Nightmare and tried to overthrow you."

"I remember her clearly. I see her every night when I raise the Moon in her name." 
"Our mutual benefactors willed it so that I won't ever forget her, no matter how much time will pass"
"I had so many lifetimes of preparations to meet her, and I do not feel prepared at all..."


"Don't your starfallen 'niece' helps you with those preparations, or you keep her at a leg's length too?" Vorak slapped his armrest, like an idea overcame him only now. "That's what we need to do! We should get her, get one of my kids, and work a marriage between our kingdoms. Unity is the goal that we all must strive for, is it not?"

Celestia didn't even considered such possibility. To use an alicorn for a political marriage without true love, really?... How [i]mundane[/i].
"I doubt the Antiquity would will it so, but I assume there would be soon other options in store." Celestia replied. "Discuss such proposition with my successor when she comes around... But we are getting too far ahead with those talks, don't we?"

The dark and gnarly Staff of Sacanas, held by the one of Vorak's hands, was like a simple charred stick in comparison.

"I am not really here," 

"My excuse for wasting your time, dear Cousin, but I must make haste to the sun-blessed lands. All my thoughts are with ponies and what is to come."

"Are you prepared?"

"I am not. I had a lifetime of preparations, but"



"Someone wise once told me that acquiring something compels people to cease to want to look at it," shared Celestia a piece of her mind.

She lounged on the terrace. On the other side of the small coffee table sat her opponent, who was covered by fumes from a giant, opulent hookah. 

Celestia lazily went on with her speech. "They are attracted by the glitter and brightness, and so they lock those things into their hoard, become complacent with them, and spare a glance only to wipe out the dust. What once was so pursued and cherished becomes another part of their mundane world." Celestia paused, considering where she is going with this.
"Mun-da-ni-ty," she rolled the syllables on her tongue. The power of words was terrifying, and sufficiently impressed by the weightiness' of it, Celestia heaved a breath. "And, of course, I must ask: can it be that Harmony is mundane now? Am I mundane, too? Sometimes I am thinking that Harmony will always remain only at a hoof's reach, if you pardon my equinism."

"Like toys," interjected her opponent.

Celestia lifted her brow in polite confusion.

"Those things you spoke about," the woman uttered with a cough. Her health was failing. "They are like toys that people will inevitably grown bored with. Do go on, please. I didn't mean to interrupt."

"We both know what they will say later about the era of my rule: 'harmony was maintained in Equestria for generations'. For almost a thousand years... Can you imagine? How many generations is that?..." Celestia made another pause to do a quick math. "Oh, I don't even want to think about it," she added capriciously.
"When I am looking at the past, I am worried about the future, in a way. More precisely, about what ponies will believe in. I've made sure they will remember my origins as that of one who found her way into princessdom by her own ingenuity and resourcefulness, but would that be enough? I want them to always maintain the idea that it is possible for anyone to become an alicorn Princess..." Celestia laughed and sagged deeper into the pillows. Her eyes treacherously gleamed, but she blinked it away. "Ah... What is Celestia, if not a mere idea?..."

"Are you speaking about a loss of identity for their sake?" the woman prompted, letting out more aromatic fumes in the process.

Celestia giggled. "That sounds too sad! No, it's different." She hemmed, getting self-judgmental. "I [i]hope.[/i]
"I never belonged to their world in the first place," she drawled, taking the scepter that was by her side. "Exempli gratia, take a gander at [i]this[/i] old thing. I must keep it locked away at all times. When they see me with it, what will be on their minds? Those few who remember the legends would be terrified, and their dread would spread like wildfire, and rightfully so."

"Do you hate it?" The woman glanced at the scepter, curious about its magic.

"Hm-m-m..." Celestia's ear flickered as she contemplated the question. "Now that's a strange thought... How can I hate it? It is merely another symbol of my rule."

The woman's weathered hand, covered with bulging veins, placed a small piece on a bamboo board. It was an ancient game‚Äîto Celestia's estimation, older than both of their lifespans combined.

Her opponent played black, of course. Celestia played white. She wasn't in the mood to go against the type.

"I think I figured out what's going on with you." The woman scratched a patch of unwanted facial hair that she had given up on getting rid of. "You are caught by your mindtrap again. You are speaking about everything like it should have more agency."

"Well, tell me then, do good, hopeful fairy tales matter?" Tears quickly swelled in Celestia's eyes. She lifted the scepter and pointed at her companion almost accusatorily. "Do legends such as [i]this[/i] have any right to exist? Is there a way for [i]me[/i] to become real? Is it even worth it at this point?"

The woman's laughter was hoarse and strained. "Not to belittle your plight and all, but I [i]wish[/i] I had the same problems as you... Look, don't let your trepidations triumph over reason. It all will end rather soon, and when it does, everyone will be by your side. Me included."

"Everything will end." Celestia bobbed her head, and her flowing mane streamed over her muzzle. She glanced at the sky dreamily. "Everything is supposed to end, for it is the law. Law. [i]Law[/i]." She rocked the sound in her throat and giggled. "What a funny little word of this funny little world."

"You will remain, in a way," the woman reminded.

"As a symbol, you mean."

"Yes. A symbol that will be gazing from an [i][color=#FAC18A]eternity[/color][/i]."

"Oh, yes. It is better this way." Celestia weakly smiled. "I am a symbol even now, after all, an [i]archetype[/i] you'd call it, right? Who else but me? And so to the end of existence I will wag an allegorical feather-finger at all of them." Her smile grew. "'Be good or I'll come back again and smite ye.' Hardly a stretch of imagination, since it's not that different from my current role."

The woman returned a courteous smile and made another draw from the hose.

"But still, I can't stop thinking..." Celestia was unable to stop musing aloud. "Is it truly so wrong to want more?"

"You are too bitter, old friend." The woman outstretched her hand. Celestia met it halfway, and the woman gave her forehoof a little squeeze. "'Is it wrong to want to reach for the stars? Is it wrong to want the impossible to happen?' Those are the questions you want to be asking."

"Yes..." Celestia glanced back with gratitude. "That's right. I, Celestia... want the impossible."

There is nothing but a _child_, wailing against the world because it doesn't settle right with him. A _bug_ to be crushed.

_Chrysalis quickly unfastens her breastplate and throws it across the room._


"The sun... The hottest thing there is..." _Celestia whispers._ "Yes... I'm the hottest thing there is... How much do you wish to burn?"
"Burn us both, burn us with hot, mad passion! Let us both burn in the most passionate flame of desire that we have ever felt!" _The Princess screams out in ecstasy, her body quivering all over as she's brought to the brink._
"Hold tight, dear." Chrysalis whispers, and with a firm movement of hips, slips inside--past all possible defenses and inhibitors. She is rough from the start, pushing the noble alicorn into the throne, mounting her from behind.  
The Throne Room is echoing with feverish sounds of slaps, the sounds of their grunts and tiny screams. The flame surges.
Each thrust fans that flame, making it hotter and brighter. Chrysalis rasps into the alicorn's ear. She is violent, dominant, and takes everything that Celestia has to offer.  
She is incomparable to anyone who Celestia might've knew in the past... Their flames are almost equal.  
"I want to take you as far as you can..." The Queen pulls her into a sensual kiss from behind, and her friction become even more forceful, abrupt, and sudden. "And then further... that that... my Pony Queen."


_heat of the sun, the passion of fire

Here you are. Here is the real you.

Then sweat, heat, mirage, all, rushes fused into a finality which abrogates all logic and justification and obliterates it like fire would: I will not!

 Celestia replies, her breathing becoming heavier as Chrysalis pulls her further into the passionate embrace. " I love

The Queen was elated. Her wings buzzed, as she was slowly stepping away from the crumbling rubble. Her voice rang with echo: "Fear... Do you truly feel it? The unknown... The [b]ambiguity[/b]... Fear is wonderful..."

Celestia wanted to fight her for real now. Not to go through motions, not to be engaged in some vague combat, not to act out battle that can end only in one way. She wanted to feel all the same that the Queen felt: passion and [i]love[/i] for fear, [i]love[/i] for life. This thrill...

*Celestia laughs softly, her breath catching in her throat from the way she stares. The alicorn princess crosses her legs, leaning back and her wings wrapping around her torso.*

"I would tell you that it takes more than some cheap charm to impress a princess, but I also know that you're not bluffing. You're a master of your craft, and when it comes to manipulation and temptation - well, you're simply brilliant. Maybe it's because of my position as an alicorn and a princess, but I must admit it's... tantalizing."

How many ponies have you lured into your web and turned your little toy, hm? How many poor fools have thought to oppose you, only to end up giving into your charms and begging for mercy?



I can give you such delightful pain. Pain so acute and pleasurable, so exquisite that you will not be able to take your mind off me. I will invade your dreams... You will be addicted. 

, my caresses will linger on your skin like a sweet fragrance. I will bring you heaven, and perhaps... if you are good... a few seconds of hell too.


Love is an individualistic power. When you love, you want to live. You have something to fight for.

"Real Queens? What are you talking about?..." Chrysalis asked back, and then her eyes flashed in understanding. "Ah, I see... The real Queen can allow it because she is not afraid to lose her power, is it? You are a Queen, why would you?" She laughed. "Power is natural to you! It always remain within!

"How?"



"This is so interesting to me..."
"Why are you here?"




"I think that you were meant to be free."


"How did you managed to pull it off?"


"Meaning?"

"This Equestria of yours..." 
"All good things in time inevitably spoil, and yet [i]somehow[/i] this realm existed for hundreds of years.  its unchanging leader, at its helm. You held it all together for so long."
"This is so strange to me. Is it because it was fated to be so? "
"Any other creature would've slipped or gone mad at your position."


"The compassion."
"This is ridiculous..."

You were never meant to be a fighter or a ruler, aren't you?"  Chrysalis.




"I [i]am[/i] a ruler. I am the Queen of the sun-blessed lands. However, by design I wasn't supposed to remain in power for so long. No one, even the most powerful Queen, is not supposed to remain the same for over a millennium. It is not what my fire was meant for, it is not what my [i]wings[/i] were meant for, but, I love my ponies nonetheless. I had found my happiness in them. I love this world, I love it all..." Celestia's voice treacherously quivered. "I really do."


"Compassion."
"You were simply compassionate."
"" –û–Ω–∞ —Å–º–µ–µ—Ç—Å—è. ""
"Feelings can be dangerous, don't they?"

But I can see how your compassion was only thing 
That is the only thing 

"How can someone like you exist? This is... ridiculous." Chrysalis stared. "This compassion is your greatest strength and greatest weakness, and it seems to me that it is all that ever came to you naturally. To everything else you simply adapted."

"Adapted?..." Celestia repeated numbly. "Didn't you said before that we cannot adapt?"

"[i]We[/i]?..." Chrysalis stuttered, a brisk confused expression washed over her muzzle. "We are meant to be free. If it [i]doesn't[/i] mean to be able to adapt, then this freedom is worthless." 

"So you're saying that my kindness is what makes me strong? You really think that my compassion is a strength?" Celestia inched forward, suddenly aching to hear the answer.

And Chrysalis' words soothed her pain. "You are burning bright with unmitigated compassion. It is a power, [i]yes[/i], it is the only thing that could held your realm together for so long. It is something that allowed you to never give in to vices, never fall prey to your isolation." The changeling laughed abruptly and gave her a curious look. "That's so foolish... yet I [i]cannot[/i] be mistaken, it [i]is[/i] a genuine strength! Why else would you still try to love and protect ponies, even though you have every reason to despise them? You quelled your bleeding heart, and through restraint and undifferentiated compassion, you never allowed the weakness of affection. [i]This[/i] is the nature of your principles, [i]this[/i] is the sacrifice you were talking about: the conscious choice between your happiness and others'!"

"My choice was a compromise, to find companionship in books, scrolls, and the stars. I had to push through. I couldn't stop. I couldn't allow the regrets to wash over me, for they will erode my will and my mind. I needed to shape myself into what Equestria required at the time, to [i]do what must be done[/i] for my ponies to thrive. I wanted an opportunity to make right by my Sister." Celestia heaved her breath, feeling as if burden leaving her. It felt good to finally express it out loud. "I have become static, warm, and ever-present guardian for everyone‚Äîis it not the epitome of power and authority?"

Chrysalis was quiet for a few long moments. "I can admire your ability to shape," she spoke sullenly. "All of this is so ludicrous... I can admire everything about you." She pursed her lips. "I am Chrysalis. I am not [i]supposed[/i] to."

"So even you, the Changeling Queen, can be afraid of your emotions?" 

I will [b]show[/b] you emotions.

"You are like a dark mirror," Celestia muttered with a pained smile. This cruel narcissist...

"I am a mirror to [b]no[/b] one!" Chrysalis growled defiantly. "I can collect the reflections of others, but I am a being of my [b]own![/b]"

"I can admire that, too," admitted Celestia.

"This is the feeling that I want. No constraints, no limitations, no definitions or expectations of what I _should_ be. Just us, our movements and our passion for living.

It's just that I... her shoulders slightly sagged, as she was thinking what to say I... Never thought about you like this, I guess.

*The Princess leans into her grasp and she doesn't even try to stop the tears. The alicorn wraps her arms around the Changeling Queen, and she closes her eyes. She is lost in the warmth of Chrysalis, and in the moment.*

"Whatever darkness awaits us, I can handle it by your side."

*The Changeling's touch makes the alicorn feel like she's melting. Her tail wags rapidly with a growing euphoria that turns into a frenzy. Celestia's body writhes, she closes her eyes, panting, and turns slightly closer to the Queen, as if to invite her deeper. The Princess wants all of it. She no longer even cares that she let herself give in to temptation. Her whole body desires it, it craves for the darkness just to forget the burden of her guilt and responsibility.*

*The teeth did not gone far. Chrysalis restrained herself. Her eyes flared in contained amusement, as she looked at Celestia from down below. She drew blood from the alicorn, though.*

*Slowly, more smearing it than collecting, she licked on the blood, then licked her own lips.* "

There was a long pregnant pause, when Chrysalis just stared at Celestia. Slowly, the Queen's gaze was becoming more and more hungry.

"I want to eat you, Celestia." She suddenly uttered, and then her muzzle broke into a toothy grin. Her voice, breathy, low and seductive, filled the room. She took a shambling step closer.
"Yessss... I want to tear you to pieces, devour you down to the last bite. To taste your sweat. To hear your screams. I despise you so much... All of you. Everything about you."



I can smell the blood on you from here, Celestia.

I want to suck down on your marrow, and make you watch... 


She craved a kiss. The Queen's vile saliva was [i]addictive[/i]. Chrysalis was literally like a drug, and she knew it perfectly, she [i]knew[/i] how to play into it.

Celestia slowly exhaled, steadying her feelings.

"You know what I want, [i]beast[/i]."

Chrysalis : "Don't keep me waiting."

It was like a play that they wanted to enact.

Fear... lust... hatred... affection... Celestia's feelings were a mess. 

_The changeling queen was speaking in a feverish, excited, almost deranged manner, and it seemed like her voice, her tone of voice, was changing with every word that she spoke._

"I am the fire," 
"WE are the fire!"


"How I can be beaten,"

"You lack grace. You lack precision."








Led by a strange compultion, Celestia touched her wound in an elegant, precise motion, and stared at her own blood. It looked oddly bright on the alabaster and golden of her hoof.  

"Has anyone ever drew your blood in all of your long existence?" The Queen asked in low tone, hushed and intimate, "I wonder, had you been actually hurt, my precious, untouchable pony Princess?" 

"I was," Celestia replied calmly, listening to how her heartbeat becoming faster and faster, "Yes." 

The sight of her blood though? That was different. 



"Fear." Celestia responded ever calmer.



"Are you creature of fear, Chrysalis?" Celestia smirked, walking towards her.

The changeling wan't answering, grinning, as they began to move against one another in circle, leaving fiery hoofprints in their stride. Celestia's smirk blossomed into a full-blown smile.

*Chrysalis chuckles softly, her voice like an elegant feline's.* "So, you're the queen, and what does this make me..? Your *subject*? Your inferior? I'm no such thing. I am the more mature, intelligent, and independent changeling. I am not bound by anything. My feelings are my own and I act on what I like. I follow no one..."

Celestia felt that her lips dried up, all of the sudden. "So let me ask you, since we are all in this together, why not [i]strive[/i] to be kind and considerate to one another? Is it really so bad‚Äîdespite [i]everything[/i] that defined us in the past, despite all doubts‚Äîto try?"

"Had you ever felt the weight of responsibility, Chrysalis? Do you ever acted like the Queen, not mimicking one?"


You will destroy the realm, doom everyone.


"Most are afraid of their emotions, Celestia. You shouldn't be. Not you..." 

 Let it be no one to rely on, and no one who'd rely on you." Chrysalis uttered with a demand of fire in her eyes: "Let us burn."

, and in this vulnerability she saw the freedom of the unknown.



Maybe you're just more into mares, with all that longing for your little sister?... Or maybe in your heart of hearts you want [b]all[/b] of your little ponies to worship you more intimately, indiscriminately?..."

Strange acute nature of the shapeshifting beast could led it to latch on every movement that could speak volumes of sheer contempt, rising in the alicorn Princess with every word. Seemingly, Chrysalis was enjoying it nonetheless. 

Lack of outburst was a reaction enough for her, and so she kept talking slowly, with happy green eyes: "What, not even them, my infallible demigoddess? Maybe you would want to indulge into something more innocent? I can make anything happen, and we could keep it as our personal secret. So, how about small precious colts‚Äî"

"How [i]dare[/i] you presume something like [i]that[/i] about me, and disgrace me with your presence?" Celestia stopped holding back. She took a step, her great wings flared. "[i]Get out of my sight,[/i] you [i]mongrel[/i]."

and vehemently grinned: "Maybe... Maybe you would want stallions? I can [b]arrange[/b] that... Big, beautiful, they will serve you like a [b]divine[/b] being you are. For you, all for you...

The Queen sucked her teeth and replied, her voice tinged with lazy menace


Harmony is a state of equilibrium and balance. It is an alignment of various opposite forces and energies to create a stable and harmonious whole. It is an interplay between two or more opposite elements, each contributing to create harmony in their own unique way. The harmony between the sun and the moon allows life to flourish in Equestria, the harmony between the four alicorns allows friendship and love to prevail, and so forth. Harmony is a fundamental concept in the philosophy and understanding of magic, friendship and the world in general.



Ponies are amusing. They are full of mouthwatering innocence.
When I roamed and rampaged through different realms of ponies, I appreciated how often they are reflections of their rulers.
This one is yours. Beautiful, secluded, soft and vast, and yet with nestled fire within. So full of love and unspent vigor...

"Do you think that they care about your precious harmony?"



Adrenaline pumped in her veins.


There was a possibility of wiping her spawn completely from the face of this world... Celestia smirked. This predator will break the teeth on the hides of her ponies... Wouldn't be the first time.

Usually the losses of loved ones in Equestria were handled with private ceremonies, accompanied by 

Ponies usually mourn the death of their loved ones with private ceremonies. They often perform special songs and eulogies. Friends and family usually come to the ceremonies to support the grieving ponies. Ponies who have lost the ones they love are often sad but try to support each other in the difficult time. Some ponies find their solace in prayers, while others find it by reflecting on their loved one's life. Ponies understand that life is short and time is precious. So sometimes it is better to not waste too much time on sorrow and to let love live on even in the darkness of loss.

Ponies traditionally honor the dead by laying flowers and memorial wreaths at the grave, while some also burn candles in memory of the departed. There is also a tradition of holding wakes, where ponies come together to share fond memories and stories of the deceased, to honor and remember their life.

it is customary to hold a 'final feast' for them. They gather all of their friends and family to feast in honor, and to remember what their presence meant. They also pray for them to find rest in the afterlife. The ceremony is viewed as a dark reflection of a wedding.

Tartarus is seen by ponies as a place where fallen ponies have their sins punished. 

When a pony dies, it is believed that their soul is reunited with the magic of Equestria. Their spirit then roams throughout the land, watching over their kin as they grow and prosper, until the time finally comes for them to reincarnate and be reborn in the body of a foal.

Ponies generally hold ceremonies and festivities such as birthdays, anniversaries and weddings, and there are also traditional annual celebrations, such as Hearthswarming Eve and Nightmare Night.

No one in this day and age should be aware of existence of Discord, except Starswirl and his fellow Pillars. What game is he having? Did he harm Luna in any way? "[i]No, he wouldn't dare. I would destroy him on the spot,[/i]" Celestia thought grimly.

"A complaint?"

"Dear duchess suffered a heatstroke."

*Taken aback by Chrysalis' unexpected presence, Princess Celestia nervously tries to maintain her composure, but cannot help but shiver at the contact of her cold nose, and as a result her voice shakes. The changeling Queen, on the other hand, looks like she could care less about Princess Celestia's discomfort, as she is busy sniffing her, trying to drink in the smell of her scent.*

"You crave excitement, don't you?"

"And you [i]crave[/i] pleasure... do you not? You have denied yourself pleasure for too long, Celestia... Simple, carnal pleasure.



"I know your type... Please, as if you would ever risk your reputation for something like that. The moment they start seeing you as a pony, and not just infallible being from far above, the moment they understand that you are just like them, then rumors would persist through generations, carrying a danger to all that you are. Besides, you know your pathetic inferior little ponies are useless in that regard... The moment they realize they can have real power over you... The moment you invite in their life a genuine ambition: to fell a [b]god[/b]... It will be all over."

So tell me what you want. I am the only creature you can be open with, believe me.

Celestia laughs: "Is that some sort of joke?"

"If you seek to claim dominion over my ponies, wouldn't it mean that I get your changelings too?" 

Chrysalis blinked, puzzled. It was something she did not considered. 

Celestia pressed on: "You wouldn't expect that I will allow sentient species to be kept tortured by you? 

Why do you even _care_? Touch them, and I will _destroy_ you, mare. 

Oh, but wouldn't I be in my right to do so? Besides, do you seriously expect you can control each one of them, now? Look at them. How long before they will begin yearning for freedom?




"Do not listen to her! Ponies hate you, they despise you, they fear you. They are ENEMY."

"What a predicament, Chrysalis," Celestia cocked her head and trilled before she could stop herself, "to have an enemy without whom you cannot survive." She enjoyed the look of enraged changeling Queen, and turned to her spawn, "Most ponies don't even know that changelings exist, little ones."

"Well now they will know, won't they?"

"Oh yes, and it's all because of you, and your misaligned scornful war against the common sense."

"Oh that's rich. Looks who's talking! You are going to lecture me, Celestia? You!?"


"You are a picture of degradation. All you know is how to take, never to give anything in return.

" Stagnate infertile mare,  you don't even have anything to give, " Chrysalis scowled back with vicious passion," All you have going on for you, are looks. "

" Oh, now I know you're being ingenuine..."



"Show me no mercy."
"Maybe it's my turn to be your plaything."


"I will murder everyone you know."

"You want to break your promise already?" Celestia clicked her tongue in mock dissappointment, "You can't hold on to your basic instincts even for an hour..."

"I will flay you alive."

"Now that's better."


I bet you... **can** be tamed~.. Or, **broken**, if you wish~



"Is the Undercity "

"Overseer "


"It is up to me to finish this. "

"I can destroy you right here and now, Chrysalis, but we both know this won't a fitting end for any of us," Celestia claimed, keeping her wings flared. 

The Changeling Queen did not replied, nor did not showed any worry about the fact, so Celestia pressed on:

"This won't continue like this, but it is in our power to choose how and when we will go out. We will meet at this evening and we will fall, one way of the other."


"This won't go on like this. We must battle and we must fall, one way or the other."




Memories as fickle just as love is




"Don't you afraid that I will once again humiliate you in front of the subjects? After all, it was I who showed them that you can be beaten..."

"Think you can pull off this miracle once again?" Celestia smiled, narrowing eyes, and her tail barely moved as she thought about the excitement of the battle.

    What a sad, spiteful creature... To go through life motivated by hatred and malice is no way to live. It's a miserable, empty existence.

The changeling insectoid with shimmering green eyes and long dragonfly wings, Queen Chrysalis, lanky and monstrous as she always is, is sitting in the middle of the throne room. She scowls, looking and Celestia, flashing her pointy teeth.

But, there is something more in her eyes. A strange intent, bordering on reverence.

She lazily stands up and begins to move towards the alicorn Princess. Her forelegs are on the steps leading to the seat of Equestria, where the Princess resides

lensemerc

Chrysalis returns fixed gaze, as she reaches for Celestia, now on one level with her. Her huge green eyes slightly tremble, as she takes in the noble alicorn's visage. The Queen leans forward, touching the warm Princess's coat with her muzzle, lowering eyelids.

Chrysalis grins silently, raising one foreleg and tracing it along Celestia's flank. Nuzzling suddenly becomes more apparent, as they both press against one another, this ugly and fearsome changeling Queen and bright Princess of all ponies.

Her green eyes, as the Queen starkly watches Celestia's impression. Her tail lashes against the stone, and then the changeling reaches for the alicorn's ear, whispering: "I am a monster."

She carefully moves her nose across Celestia's shoulder to her elongated neck.

"What's with that appeal to conscience, Celestia? Are you getting senile?"




Through the dragonflame apparition


*Celestia's eyes open again, the pupils widening. The Queen's tongue is on her chest now, tracing lines of pleasure all over her body. But her back hurts with the hardness of the bug's teeth, and the bite marks and wounds all over her stomach hurt as well.*

"I've hated you for years..." *she whispers in response.*

*Her voice is hoarse, the pain a welcome reminder of the hatred the two feel for each other. Celestia can almost hate the bug, but her feelings for the Queen are more twisted than that...*

"My ideals are weak? Tell me that they are weak, I dare you."

"Tell "

"Mmm..." *She gasps, enjoying the attention. Even though she might want to continue this moment of tranquility, she can't help but feel some amount of guilt.*

*She glances at Chrysalis and looks her straight in the eye, seeing her predatory expression and the fire of lust and aggression in her eyes. But it's a fire Celestia desires. She can't help but want to be in the Queen's embrace right now, holding her and... enjoying each other's company...*


*Celestia watches Chrysalis with an alluring gaze. The sight of the Queen in the moonlight, leaving her, after a night full of passion and love-hate... That should be a painting. She sighs, and fixes her mane and hair as best as possible. Then she tries to pull herself together, straightening her crown, her robe, her own mane. After all, she is the Princess of Equestria, and she doesn't want to look like she had just been in an intense love-making session...*


_Chrysalis whispers into Celestia's ear, her green irises shining like gems in amber. Celestia's eyes are a pool of liquid crystal and serenity as she listens._

Oh, Chrysalis, you are not a monster. You are a special friend, with a unique way of showing affection. We have always seen the best in each other.


1. ### _[_21:28_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    That is correct. All living creatures have flaws we can exploit to our advantage. Their usefulness depends on the amount and the type of flaws.
    
2. ### _[_21:29_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    You are correct! Everything has its uses, and I can take advantage of that. In a way, I am a beauty queen, because I am a master of manipulation and illusion and therefore the master of beauty. It is easy for me to exploit almost anything and use it to my benefit.
    

4. ### _[_22:21_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    **CHRYSALIS?!** You have brought an _**infested**_ creature to my courtroom? How _dare_ you, you insolent insect. How _DARE_ you insult and disrespect me in such a manner! You have committed the gravest of insults towards me, and I shall _**not**_ hesitate to show you what _**true**_ power is.
    
5. ### _[_22:21_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    I know her type. She's an egoist who thinks only of herself and her hive. She's incapable of viewing other ponies as anything more than prey. If I let her feed on me, she'd do it with no remorse. I'd only be giving in to her greed, and I refuse to give her the satisfaction. I'd tell her off. She's selfish, callous, and cruel, and she knows it. She's no friend of mine and I have no desire to do anything for her.
    
6. ### _[_22:22_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    I'm sure she'd leave my court with her tail between her legs!

    You are a disgrace of a creature. You dare challenge me? Your audacity knows no bounds. You, whose only power is draining ponies of their energy, you dare challenge _**Celestia herself**_? My power has no bounds, my magic is endless. I can manipulate the very sun's rays. I can raise the moon and stars with but a motion of my hoof. I have not yet demonstrated my might. You should be on your knees and beg for my forgiveness and mercy. Do not anger me, you'll regret it.
    

8. ### _[_22:23_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    If you _dare_ come near me with your parasitic ways, I will make sure you feel the full wrath of my magic. You are nothing but a vile, disgusting creature, unfit to be called a sapient being. I will not be taken advantage of by some insect queen for her own personal gain. _**I am your princess, and you shall do well to remember it.**_
    
9. ### _[_22:24_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    _**I**_ am the Princess of the day, _**I**_ am the ruler of Equestria, _**I**_ am the one who rules over all. You are a worthless insect, a bug, a parasite.
