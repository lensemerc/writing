She was just an ordinary pony. Nothing special.

There were hundreds like her.


"Twilight Twinkle, my little pony..." he said with a tired, wise smile, "Would you like to learn about magic?"

Оливер за анализ. His comprehensive analysis offered a one-of-a-kind distant inspiration while outlining the story and themes for QotD and writing the characters. I expect to refer to his writings a lot while finishing the series.

What I wanted for QotD I, for it to have almost mythical feel to it. Ancient, weird entities are clashing for the fate of the world and all the regular beings in it. Everything can be explained, but also defies a concrete explanation. The soul of a fantasy and wonder, in my opinion, lies in things like that, in very real themes that are also interwoven with a fable.

That being said, a good fable must have a moral, even if it is something simple -- like an idea that we need to hold onto hope during dark times, for example.
