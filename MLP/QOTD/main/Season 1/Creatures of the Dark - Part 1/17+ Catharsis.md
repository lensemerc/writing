"I do not want anything for myself.


"Is it so wrong, to know that strength is not everything?"

"Strength? No. But [b]power?[/b] Power [b]is[/b] everything..."

"What is power to you?"

Про ветер. Про звезды. Про пот. Про чувства. Про боль.


"Are you really content with sitting in your palace and watching them to be happy? There is no true happiness in that. See, life is like [b]sex[/b]. You can't stay away while living. The moment you distance yourself and start to ponder, the [b]act[/b] has already ended, Princess." Chrysalis cackled, "All you left with, with your own thoughts, your emptiness. We all need to fill ourselves with something, aren't we?..." 


“Love… that **is** a strange word,” *Celestia murmured, smiling and looking up at Chrysalis.*

“But **love**… is **a wonderful** thing.”

*She tilted her head and her neck crinkled as she did.*

“…Do you truly love me?” *Celestia asked.*

*She seemed to ponder for a moment, looking away, thinking to herself. And then she spoke again.*

“…**Love** is wonderful, and terrible, and exciting… and **terrifying**.”


*Celestia giggled softly.*

*Her eyes widened, and a light shiver ran down her spine.*

"Love is **wonderful**, my love." *She purred passionately.*

"Love is **passion**, and **energy**, and **light**, and **laughter**."

*She chuckled, and pressed herself against the Queen's hooves, wrapping her wings around the changeling.*

"Love is **heat**, and **fire,** and **emotion**."

*She licked her queen's neck gently.*

"I **love** you, my Queen."


"So this is what you want? A world of perfect equinox..."


"All I wanted is to be with my Sister"


"My... My belief is not foolish!" *Celestia hissed, her eyes widening.*

"There is good in ponies, and I refuse to give up on that belief! As long as there is light in the darkness, I will **not** give up on them!" *She exclaimed.*

"You may hate ponykind, and my love for them will forever be a mystery to you." *The alicorn looked at her with a frown and lowered her voice.* "But to me, you were nothing more than a **monster** at the start."

"I do not seek to change your belief, don't get all fiery on that," Chrysalis waved her foreleg dismissively, and chuckled, "Believe in goodness. That's why I adore you. You're infallible in it, and this is what **draws** me to you."

She glanced mischievously.

"There's nothing more desirable than strength of a character in a person. And yet, if you let me to be feared by them, is it really something bad? Don't subjects need something to be afraid of? So goodness in someone like you can be contrasted and shine even brighter? Be **merciful**, Celestia. Comfort them, when they will be scared by me. See, what I propose?"

*Celestia paused for a moment, mulling over her words.* "... I have considered letting my subjects be afraid of you... And my little Nightmare Night tradition serves this same purpose."

"But I know all too well how terrifying you are to the ponies of Equestria... If you terrorize and scare them, I won't be able to comfort them, love." *She sighed, and her eyes widened.* "And I'm afraid I can't let you terrorize them, not even if you make me fall **more** in love with you."


*Celestia sighed softly, enjoying the sensation of Chrysalis's lips on her skin.*

"Yes, **my love**... I love your darkness..." *She giggled softly, her eyes sparkling with passion.*

"I **love** being opposed to you... **Contrasting** with you..." *She smirked.*

"I do not want a partner that mirrors myself." *She whispered seductively.*

"I want someone who is my **opposite.** And you, my love... **You are everything** that I am **not.**"



"There's **so much** I love about you..." *Celestia whispered, her eyes glinting seductively.*

"We are different, but you are **right.** We are **compatible.** Your **energy** is what I **lack.** Your **brilliance** and **confidence** is what I'm missing."

"I **love** your confidence, and your pride."

*She purred, and snuggled up against the Queen.*

"I **love** your darkness..."

*She nipped at Chrysalis's ear.*



"I'm so tired."

"


"**Life** is a challenge, after all. It is a constant competition. It is something that your ponies don't seem to truly grasp, don't they?"

"They don't..." _Celestia sighed softly, thinking about her subjects._

"They are naive and they are easily influenced... They follow my rule because they like it that way... They think I know best." _She chuckled._ "I should be **so** stern and harsh for the sake of maintaining order..."

"I don't think they require much to exert order. And you love it this way, don't you? You love them.. manageable."


"No, no, they **don't...**" _Celestia mumbled, still staring at Chrysalis, enraptured by her presence._ "They don't know the meaning of competition..."

"They don't realize that there is glory in **conquering**... They don't realize that by overcoming adversaries and foes, they can **become** something **more**." _Her face flushed a bit as she said that._ "Not in my society, where every one of them has a purpose, Chrysalis. In this gentler place... I wanted to leave things like that for Twilight, for her to decide, what to do with that."

"But what about your purpose, Celestia? 

"What, to feed you?


"But tell me, don't you think that world [b]needs monsters?[/b]"

"The world doesn't need killers, murderers and criminals."

"And yet here we always are, standing up again and again, no matter how hard you try to push us down. Such is nature."

"What are talking about?... Listen to yourself. You celebrate destruction, you revel in sin. Your existence is a fallacy, a consequence of failures in system. Your darkness..." Celestia's voice trailed off. She knew it wasn't the whole truth. 

Chrysalis pressed harder: "So you want to fix me? You want to force your harmony over us all? We will only fight [b]stronger[/b] against it. No, Celestia, see, someone needs to [b]be[/b] a monster. You have so much power, yet you're lacking in strength... Let me be [b]your[/b] monster, so you won't need to become one."

So you want to serve me?

"No, not to [b]serve[/b]," she replied, indignant, "Let me do things that you won't. Let me be everything that you cannot. Let me [b]be[/b] something to be afraid of."

The Solar Princess stared at Chrysalis for a longest time. Then uttered quietly: "Adhesion to the process and admittance of it is no different than direct participation. You seek to corrupt me, to make me like yourself. You want to prove that your point is stronger. You always was about that, about conflict, not cooperation."

"You are the only creature in the entire world I can lend my trust in," Chrysalis slowly traced a hoof on Celestia's cheek, "No, I am not same monster as I was before. Now I [b]am[/b] the Queen of Equestria, aren't I?" She cackled, "Just imagine now, a legion of trained infiltrators and shapeshifters, loyal to you... to [b]us[/b]. A dream for [b]any[/b] ruler, and I grant you it almost [b]free[/b] of charge."

"All you want is for me to close my eyes to your atrocities," the Princess replied in strained voice, "Is that it?"

"I do not require any forgiveness, not from you, not from ponies," Chrysalis pressed her forehead to Celestia's, her wolfish smile widened, "Hate me for that, if you will. I really don't care. You know what I am after... All I want is to remain myself. To be acknowledged by you." She leaned closer, "We can be so [b]powerful[/b] together..."

"It is not power that I am after..." Celestia .

"Naturally, since you have so much to [b]spare[/b]..."

How did it all come to this? Here she was, being seduced by this creature, a known deceiver and a murderer, and yet her rebellious heart wanted something new. A path, not downtrodden. A choice, full of fear and change. 

"[i]Something changed.[/i]" 

"[i]When we are afraid, we are pressing forward anyway,[/i]" she remembered. Oh, little [i]Cadance[/i]...

"I do not believe you," Celestia whispered, "I know that you will try to use me to your own end, that you hate me, and even if you somehow think otherwise right now, your own [i]nature[/i] won't let you to be in peace with me. You will turn on me, and betray everything that I am standing for. You would be my downfall, you wicked, vile beast."

Chrysalis exhaled sharply, pressing against her, and Celestia slowly leaned to her drooped-down ear.

"The moment you become bored... No... [i]One[/i] misunderstandment is all that would take for you to turn on me, and to revert fully to your wicked ways. You are a creature that sees [i]commitment[/i] itself as a weakness. To depend on another for you is like making a cardinal sin against your own nature. You are a prideful, shortsighted thing."

The Queen chuckled. "So what of it now? What do you want to tell me, demigoddess?"

"I want you to show me your [i]heart[/i]," Celestia spoke in commanding, quiet voice.

They looked at each other starkly, trying to understand each others' true intent. There was pure bewilderment in the Queen's eyes. 

The Princess pressed on: "Show me that there's something in you that truly [i]worth it[/i] for Equestria, as well as for me. Show me that you can [i]try[/i] to follow through with your words and actions."

In a strange moment of weakness, Chrysalis tried to move her muzzle away, but Celestia won't let her, grabbing her chin and locking gaze.

"I know that inside of you there [i]is[/i] capability to create," Celestia said sternly, "I want to see what you can do when your hunger is satisfied. Do you understand me?"

"Do you [i]demand[/i] it of me?" Chrysalis asked nervously, "Do I have to obey you now?"

"I ask you. You are being [i]asked[/i]. For us, for any of this to work—[i]please[/i], Chrysalis. Even if the world has wronged you, show me that you are still capable of caring and loving. Show me your heart."

"You make it sound so droll," Chrysalis cackled, "World did not [b]wronged[/b] me. But, still..." She was silent for a moment, and a pensive expression was on her muzzle. She sighed.



Celestia: "For the world to progress, immortal creatures like me need to dissapear. We are unnatural, we defy logic. This is for the best. We will just hold others back."
Chrysalis против


Following our desires without fear reveals who we are. Am I wrong?


Yes, if you were even slightly less powerfull, I would've killed you...


"All passions die down, eventually."

"All passions die down?" _Celestia muttered, giggling softly._ "How much of a pessimistic monster **were** you, I wonder?"


She turned to changelings, teeth bared, voice demanding:

"All hail Celestia!"

"All hail... All hail..."

Celestia could stop it at any second.


Chrysalis took knee before her, and changelings followed. She knew perfectly well what she is doing. Her green eyes shone with happy, victorious lust.

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

Flash Magnus, pale, removed his helmet, staring wide-eyed.

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

It felt [i]good[/i].

A life of ignorance is one of misery and emptiness, a life spent crying and begging. Even if it is not something one can obtain, a true love of people, a true desire to unite, improve, and enlighten is something we must strive for. To be able to inspire and help others, and to be able to be inspired and helped, this is the way to a life of strength, purpose, and meaning."


"Tell me, Celestia..." The Queen lifted Celestia's muzzle, staring deep into her eyes. The changeling's mane was unkempt. Its green eyes were stark and burned with fiery passion for destruction, with concealed hate, which could be set anew in fire of desire at any moment. It was a pure emotion in equine form. "Tell me," the Queen repeated, "my ancient enemy... When you look at me, what do you see?"

_With their faces so close to eachother's, Celestia could feel the queen's warm breath._
"I... I see a creature so similar to me... So familiar... It's like I can see myself in you."
_The princess couldn't be sure what to answer, but the queen's intense stare was not something she could just ignore by saying nothing._
"You are my reflection, my past. I see what I have become and... and what I never imagined I would ever be. I see my enemy and my lover. My foe and my friend."




Are you ready to take their free will away?

Free will? 

Are you ready to take my free will away?  


Who you are and what you do is entwined...


Don't you want to have a choice? Don't you want to have wants of your own?


Oh, but it is better to see an illusion of benevolent goddess, isn't it?



"Such words are born of pain, pain which turns to hate and anger. And yet, that pain is shared, not just with humanity, but with most life in the galaxy, because we all feel what it is to cry, to suffer, to ache for connection. And to believe that our happiness begins from within ourselves, that is the greatest delusion, as well as the greatest truth. And it can only be achieved by looking inward, toward the source of that pain, that anger, and that hate: Ourselves."
