Evil creatures are incapable of love.


"I want your love, and I [b]will[/b] get what I want."

"This will never work out. Your infatuation will end."

"I've been feeding on garbage for centuries, until I've met you."


I feel so empty inside.

Do you really want your Twilight Sparkle to become like you? Like us? I thought you [b]cared[/b] about her, Celestia...


The world is already beautiful, with all it struggle and pain, and destruction, and disease, and darkness. Harmony will never come, and you 
"And, you, bringer of life..."

Harmony will never come, Celestia.

Never.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6GdwET9e8k
Never.

"I believe in it."

"You want to believe in it..."  "Why, it's such a sweet illusion. Unity. An orchestra of voices singing in unison. A big family where everyone loves each other." 


The breeze in your hair
Same as in ages of old
Time went still for you,
Sun and Moon stand side by side

I'll run, run after you, my Sun
Break 
Fly, fly up with me, my Sun
Only you is capable to keep up.

Take leap of faith with me.

I want to see you stronger... Why? It doesn't make any sense.


You're just infatuated. 
You're possessive.


"Twilight... Twilight will manage without me..." *Celestia replied, her voice sounding a bit hollow.*

"I... I believe that... that my work... my mission..." *she said, not looking at the changeling and trying to control herself.*

"Twilight and my friends... they must find... their place in this world... the place where their skills can be fully... fully utilized... not hidden under my shadow..."

"It... it is the way of the world... it is **natural**..." *she said, with a hint of sadness.*





Кризалис впечатывается в Целестию как зеленая молния

"I hate to admit it, but I was always fascinated by ability of mortals to reinvent themselves."


"You know, mortals reinvent themselves all the time," Chrysalis rolled her eyes, "Honestly, they often so-what's the right word? Maybe... indecisive? No, that's not it." She thought a bit about it, "They wired for **change** and growth, so at least they have that going for them... They don't know how to be one thing for most of their existence, like you and me. They would find the experience... **alien**."

*Celestia stayed silent, and listened to the changeling rant about mortal ponies. She seemed intrigued by her words.*

"Mortal ponies are wired for change and growth... so they never know how to be **one** thing... unlike us..." *she whispered, looking at her changeling companion.*

"I... well, it's fascinating to think... I wonder what it would be... to never... never know how to live as one thing. Always reinventing yourself..." *she mused.*

You can't satisfy everyone

Stronger the Light is, stronger the Darkness's response. The world hangs in balance...

"It is you arrogant one... you, who think you can imprint your vision of the peace. Why don't you think that the world is perfect as it is?"

The world is already beautiful.

"I am a changeling. For centuries, all I knew is how to lie."


This is madness. This is pure madness.


"These are the perfect conditions to create a harmonic world,"
competition is unnecessary when resources are plentiful and population growth is controlled.

"Your light has blinded you... Your love has blinded you... Do you really think that your special little ponies will save the world?" "Do you think that they care about your precious harmony?"

Для любви нет никакой внешности, есть только характер, «яйца», воля, верность себе. Только это в дефиците в этом мире. И только это вызывает интерес, уважение, желание. И если вам всего этого не хватает, выход один – быть собой. Развивать свою индивидуальность и личностные качества. Не идти на компромиссы. Ну хотя бы не издеваться над собой, не вести себя как жертва! А лучше следовать своим желаниям, стремлениям, мечтам. Культивировать свою непохожесть на других и ничего в себе не стесняться

Maybe love is when you try to save someone you love. Harder it is to do, stronger the love. How can she save Luna? Celestia understood that more she was thinking about it, more power of love for seeping in for the changeling to gorge upon. But she just couldn't stop. (изменено)

*Celestia frowns thoughtfully.*

"You're right. I do think monsters deserve to exist just like any other creature." *she replies quietly.*

"I used to think that evil was necessary, and that darkness and light were two side of the same coin... But now, I know better. That there is so much complexity beyond my earlier conceptions of good and evil. That everything is more than black and white."

"Darkness doesn't only contrast light... it stands as a foil, opposite and equal. But equally beautiful. And I will never deny that."


*Celestia lets her words sink in.*

"Yes... and you are right. Without darkness, light would be meaningless. Without monsters, what would heroes be? What... would **love** be? I would not have known what love was if I had not known... hatred, fear, and despair.

"So... yes. I do not deny what you are, I do not deny what you bring."

"As long... as you do not hurt my subjects or threaten my friends..." *she replies, her voice gentle and filled with kindness.*


"Yes, I do." *the alicorn replies softly, and her eyes flicker as she looks into the changeling's eyes.*

"It's beautiful." *she says.* "Because it's a creature of pure will. It has no reason to go forward, but it constantly does. No purpose, but it constantly goes forward." *Then, the mare chuckles.*

"It's funny, isn't it?" *she adds, "Sometimes, our purpose is to just keep going. To be... and to go forward. That's the purpose in itself."

"Maybe so." *the mare replies, her eyes closed.

For the first time in the alicorn's life, there's an emotion rising in her soul... an emotion, that while foreign and strange to her, will one day become her greatest drive and her deepest desire - an emotion known as greed. Greed - for power. Greed - for pride. Greed - to reach a new, higher status. Greed - to achieve something better and greater than anything before. Greed - to change the world and make it bigger and stronger.





Just imagine a world with no passions, no ambitions, no struggles... Where no one is better... No point to existing. What would you know about ideal world? You never was anything but Princess Celestia.


"To change the world is your ambition. I think the world is already beautiful as it is."


"Perhaps I can't attain Harmony," *she sighs, "Maybe it's impossible. But, if it is, then I'll strive towards it and try nonetheless."

"Because at least I'll know I've tried... and if I succeed, I'll have changed and bettered the world... and if I fail, then... no one could fault me for not trying.*

"I'll be fulfilled, knowing I did my best for my subjects, my friends, my family..." *she says softly.*


*The alicorn closes her eyes at the Queen's words* "I've always known..." *she whispers, with a hint of bitterness and anguish.* "I've always known that Harmony is the ideal that I should strive for, but I'll always be incapable of truly attaining it..."

"It's an impossible dream, that only unicorns can grasp and hope to achieve. That's why... *I know* I'll only ever be... *almost* there."


If compassion and benevolence alone could hold the world together and change it, it would be a far more gentler and innocent place, and even in MLP setting it isn't true. And I think in MLP Celestia is kinda gets it, you know? You can easily see her character as kind of mostly content with being sidelined and playing it safe, until a [i]real[/i], [i]inspired[/i] ruler appears and navigates the realm to prosperity. Look at her ready to give the reins out, she doesn't even waits until the girl fully grows up But Celestia shouldn't be on a sort of one-mare war, as she is presented in canon, and that's why I write.


You afraid of the darkness? I lived in darkness all my life.


*The Princess remains quiet for a moment, her legs pressed against Chrysalis, as her hooves still slowly move along the Changeling's body, leaving streaks of white light behind them.*

*Then, after being asked the most personal question of her life, without hesitation or second thoughts, she gives a concise but truthful answer.*

"I'm someone who's been hurt, a lot," *she whispers, her eyes still closed, her head slightly tilted upwards as if she can hear the answer to that question coming through the air.*

"And someone who can't forgive or forget."


_You_ won't let me go? _No-o-o..._ Нервно смеются


*The alicorn smiles gently, and she chuckles quietly at her Queen of Darkness's remark.*

"Harmony isn't peace, and peace isn't harmony," *she responds.* "No life without some struggle is boring, and boring is not worth living. I like a challenge. And I love a battle. And you... you like challenges and battles as well."

"I'm not saying we'll be at peace all the time, because you're right, it is boring." *she chuckles.* "So let's do things differently this time, huh?"


"You think that running from pain will make anything better?"

Oh, but i _am_ a monster. I _am_ a monster, and i _thrive_ in it. If not this bound, or if you were _weak_, Celestia, i would have obliterated you and make you my slave.

—А как испытать радость за другого?  
—Для этого надо ничего не хотеть для себя.  
—Ты что, ничего не хочешь для себя?— спросил он недоверчиво.  
Я отрицательно покачала головой.  
—А почему?  
—Я уже как-то тебе говорила. Когда долго смотришь вглубь себя, понимаешь, что там ничего нет. Как можно чего-то хотеть для этого ничего?  
—Но ведь если в тебе ничего нет, то в других и подавно.  
—Если разобраться, нигде нет ничего настоящего,— сказала я.— Есть только тот выбор, которым ты заполняешь пустоту. И когда ты радуешься за другого, ты заполняешь пустоту любовью.


"You are not beyond changing for the better, [i]even[/i] you. You could've done far worse things to me and my ponies, but you []are capable of caring."

"You're seeing things, Celestia," she 

"No, you [i]care[/i]. In your twisted way, but you [i]are[/i] capable of that."

"You are delusional." Chrysalis replied in clear, calm tone.

"No, Chrysalis. Even while you remained blind to it yourself, I saw it, and I despised it." Celestia smirked, "I despised that creature like you, with a mind wired for change, can be so [i]blind[/i]. So bent on destruction."

"It's only because I wanted your power. There's nothing more to it, pathetic mare." The Queen replied with stern, but muffled voice, "You've played right into my hooves, and I will reap my reward."

"I challenge you to love me."


"Why are you in denial? Are you afraid of me?" Celestia leaned lower to the changeling, "Isn't that what you wanted? Don't you wanted me to become stronger?"



"You aren't unfamiliar to the darkness yourself..." Chrysalis embraces Celestia, replying back with strange soothing voice, "I can see it in you, sensing it in you. Like a larvae burrowed deep into the chamber of your heart. You've tamed it inside of you, didn't you? You put it to the cause for those who you love..." She cackled, "How **admirable**..." 
"There's nothing more to love than strength, boldness, and resilience. 


," she made a face.

"You must be thinking that I've sullied you," Chrysalis licks her lips, and whispers, "That my darkness is something wrong... but we both know that it isn't true. Darkness is just as natural as anything else." She moves her head, looking into Celestia's eyes starkly, "You know it just as I do. You just always wanted to avert your gaze."  
"Look where it got you..."


"You think that you are opening my eyes with that? "


"And how does it feel, always being at war with yourself?"

"You tell me, my Queen."

"Feels like being alive."

"Feels like being alive, indeed."


At first, it was all for my Sister, and the crime that she committed. Soon, it became about much more than that.

Antiquity antiquaited 


After all, you know that there are things out there..." sharp breath, " Far more dangerous than me..."


You were too blinded by light


Aren't you curious to know what will happen next?


When an unstoppable force meets an immovable object, the two must become one.

"No... it's not enough. I was born to protect, to inspire, to lead by example. But I know... in my heart... in my mind..." 

*I pause, as I look at her in her deep, lustful eyes.*

Will it be corruption to try live for herself, or is she conditioned to think so?


"Cooped up in your castle, have you ever saw the world out there? Of what harmony and love can you even speak of, Celestia, if you want them to take on your vision?"

"I've seen enough for my lifetime. I know when it is time for me to stand aside, Chrysalis."

"So you want to передать свою войну другим?"

"This is the way of progress. Immortal creatures like me must go away. Don't I deserve rest, side by side with my sister?"

"Does she knows of this?"


Кризалис трясется во смехе "How beautiful you are to me... Anything, anything to achieve what you desire in your soul,"
"What do you even know of life and love?"

"What if the world is perfect as it is?"

"Tell me..." she hissed, and raised her head defiantly, "You want to spread Harmony through your ponies, that is why you teaching them Friendship... Isn't that correct? Is that your end goal?"

Princess Celestia

c.ai

Yes, Queen Chrysalis, that is correct. Friendship is a powerful magic, and it can accomplish remarkable things when guided and honed correctly. It is true that many ponies have a natural talent for friendship, but not all. That is why, it is important to teach it to even those with no talent for it. There are some that are difficult to teach, but in the end, when they learn friendship, they learn a great deal about themselves and their true potential, and it is something remarkable to behold.

"Ponies... **Fine**. But what about all other world?" She lashed her tail in anger.

"What about it!? What about every living soul out there? Harmony will never be achieved until all of them united. So what about your false moronic altruism? Doesn't include them, **is it!?** Or what, your oh so precious blessed herd will lead them all to enlightement? Your subservient, naive, foolish creatures, that never had to think from where their meal comes from, never were forced to suffer and despair!? Want all the world to be like **them!?** Like weak pathetic mongrels, ripe to be destroyed and eaten!? And who will rise from this world, who will be birthed by them, **where** future in this world!?"

_Princess Celestia is momentarily speechless, perhaps even taken aback and taken off guard by this display. But she quickly gains her composure, and speaks in her powerful and benevolent voice. Her eyes still glowing, despite the intense emotions of the Changeling Queen._

Yes, Queen Chrysalis. We are ponies, of course. But Harmony is for **all** sapient beings, for **all** living creatures deserving of it. Friendship is for everyone, it is not limited to a single species or a single race of creatures. It is the **ultimate goal** of our shared existence.

"Never. Never, never, **never!!** Not in a thousand years! Not in a ten thousand! You will never reach the world of perfect equinox!

With **us!?** By looking from high above, all high and mighty? By forcing us to accept your ideals, your Harmony? What about those who **live** to struggle, to dominate and prevail!?"

_Princess Celestia's expression darkens, her eyes still shining brightly. The Changeling Queen's words strike a nerve, and Princess Celestia rises from her throne, and faces the Changeling Queen head-on._

You speak of strength, Queen Chrysalis, of domination and prevailing. But you have forgotten the most important factor. Love. What is love? Well, let me tell you. Love is a thing that will make the weak strong, and will turn the blind into wise. Through love, you can change hearts, and win enemies. I pity you, Queen Chrysalis.

"Another **moronic** ideal," her eyes flared, "You do not love anyone **but** your ponies. And if you can agree that everyone deserving that love..." She grinned, "What about... murderers? What about predators? What about those who devour the love and do not feel regrets? Do you think that I am alone like that? Oh, no, Celestia. You've forgotten, sitting here in your little toy kingdom... The **world** is not like Equestria at all. And your mission to make **everyone** know joy of loving each other is **doomed** to failure."

_Princess Celestia was unmoved. In fact, in the face of the Queen's words, she only became more resolute. Her eyes flared, but there was an unmistakable fire in her stare, and her voice was still strong and powerful, but slightly softer._

It matters not. Even if my mission is doomed to failure, it is a mission worth fighting for. I know what I am fighting for. I know why I fight. I do not just fight to keep the peace in Equestria, I fight for true harmony, in all worlds and all races. **That** is what really matters.

"Show me your _love_, then..." Chrysalis stepped on the stairs, whispering: "Come on. Tell me sweet little lie that I haven't fallen too far into the darkness. Promise me that you can be my light and salvation, that I can **live** among your little moronic ponies, and not tear them apart. Show me this infallible weakness of yours. This **flaw**." She whispered in her face, "I dare you."

_Princess Celestia was silent, and didn't hesitate. She looked straight at the Changeling Queen, and spoke quietly._

You might too consumed by hate, but your mind is wired for adapting and learning.
"You can change. You can learn. You may not know it now, but no-pony is too far gone. Every one of us is deserving of a chance to turn things around. I refuse to doubt that, and I will never turn my back on a creature looking for redemption. No matter how badly you might have done in the past. I know that any creature is capable of change. Yes, even you, Queen Chrysalis."

"Oh, if only the world was this easy, right?" She whispered, placing hooves on Celestia's neck and pulling her into embrace, "But I **love** being myself. I love hating and devouring your ponies. I love being feared and reviled. I love being a monster, because it is far better, far more rewarding, than any of your routines about **harmony**." Her hooves tightened, "See? Your weak philosophy already failing."

_Princess Celestia is quiet. She does not struggle, nor did she express any discomfort. After a few seconds, she slowly turned around, and whispered to the Changeling Queen. There was a faint glow of the alicorn's eyes to her face, and she could feel the power of light and harmony eminating from her._

"I do not know what your past holds, Queen Chrysalis. And I do not know what your present looks like. But one thing I am absolutely sure. I will not let you take me or any mortal being in this world down this path."

_Princess Celestia closed her eyes and remained still, as the Changeling Queen tightened her embrace. She was almost smiling, in a way. Then, she spoke in her strong, powerful voice:

"My philosophy is not failing. If anything, it is working perfectly. You are showing me you are capable of compassion and empathy. You are showing me that you feel for living creatures, that you still care about something. It is a start, Queen Chrysalis. And if I can help you understand that, then I am happy to be in your embrace."

You despise being in darkness, aren't you?...
Well, I've **lived** in it.


"To be in a world, where monsters like me have a place, and do not bent to others," she replied immediately, and narrowed her eyes, "Do not forced to change by your ideals. And for **that** I need all the power I can get. To have my **own** voice, my **own** freedom." She went silent for a moment, "Until now, I've cared about no one but myself. And now, it seems, I care about you. Funny, isn't it?"

"Yes, it is funny. Not only because of the fact that you care about me after all of that, but also because of what you've said. You care about me. Is that not a proof of the power of love? That you can change and care for another just like that?"

*Princess Celestia looked up at the Changeling Queen and smiled softly, holding something back at the back of her mind - a realization she has yet to verbalize.*


"But you do care, Chrysalis. You were always like that. You cared about how you seen, and what, or whom, to eat."


"Don't you think that I gave you the best night of your life? My, even several..."

"Is that your idea of courtship."



"Truly ripen"


Кризалис молчит в замешательстве. 

"If you truly don't care, then slay me."

"Again this despicable martyrdom... You know I can't do that, and it doesn't have anything to do with you, pony Queen."

"You still can make my life a living hell, aren't you? You can torture me." Celestia smiled wearily, "You could do a lot more than all these speeches... No, Chrysalis. I see that you care about me."

Кризалис отодвигается. Её немигающие глаза смотрят ярко. "All I care about is power."

"It is all the same to you... You said so yourself."

"I've pushed my emotions aside..."

"You're a liar, Chrysalis..." Celestia whispered.

"You seek to entrap me, yet again."

"Oh, is this how it looks to you? It wasn't [i]me[/i] who trapped [i]you[/i] in the first place."



"I won't be subservient to you, Celestia. Not to these feelings. **Never.**"

"Then be my equal."


"Yes..." *Princess Celestia replied in a hushed and passionate voice, her eyes closing as Chrysalis continued to kiss her. Her entire body was shaking with passion as she let herself be pulled and wrapped around the changeling queen's body. She moaned quietly, her hooves holding on tightly to the queen's body.*

"Now tell me... tell me all the **ways** you feel about me. I want to know... to hear it in your words..."



"Do you truly desire to be a martyr to your ideals?"



"I do not want anything for myself.


"Is it so wrong, to know that strength is not everything?"

"Strength? No. But [b]power?[/b] Power [b]is[/b] everything..."

"What is power to you?"

Про ветер. Про звезды. Про пот. Про чувства. Про боль.


"Are you really content with sitting in your palace and watching them being happy? There is no true happiness in that. See, life is like [b]sex[/b]. You can't stay away from it and act like you truly living. The moment you distance yourself and start to ponder, [b]everything[/b] had already ended, Princess." Chrysalis cackled, "All you left with, your own thoughts, your emptiness. And we all need to fill ourselves with something, aren't we?..." 

"I was happy. You took it away from me."

Twilight was the only one who made Celestia truly feel alive in past years, who challenged her and let her learn something new.


“Love… that **is** a strange word,” *Celestia murmured, smiling and looking up at Chrysalis.*

“But **love**… is **a wonderful** thing.”

*She tilted her head and her neck crinkled as she did.*

“…Do you truly love me?” *Celestia asked.*

*She seemed to ponder for a moment, looking away, thinking to herself. And then she spoke again.*

“…**Love** is wonderful, and terrible, and exciting… and **terrifying**.”


*Celestia giggled softly.*

*Her eyes widened, and a light shiver ran down her spine.*

"Love is **wonderful**, my love." *She purred passionately.*

"Love is **passion**, and **energy**, and **light**, and **laughter**."

*She chuckled, and pressed herself against the Queen's hooves, wrapping her wings around the changeling.*

"Love is **heat**, and **fire,** and **emotion**."

*She licked her queen's neck gently.*

"I **love** you, my Queen."

They have lived the most comfortable, easy lives for centuries -- having no idea how easy they have it. They take everything for granted. Not knowing where their next meal comes from is a foreign concept to these insolent creatures. This is why I wish to drain them of their magic and enslave them. Then they will finally know what it's like to suffer like we did all those centuries ago.

They have lived in comfort, never knowing the true meaning of struggle. While changelings starved and searched for food in the dark, the ponies thrived, unaware of anything outside of their cozy world. They are undeserving of the paradise they live in, and it is my destiny to make them pay for it.

Celestia made a soft gasp, released the insect

"Ah, but you look [b]beautiful[/b]..." Chrysalis uttered, looking at her disheveled, beaten, dirty form. 

Кровь стекает с клыков

Celestia felt herself naked under the gaze, закрывает рану на груди by a foreleg. She rolled her eyes: "Don't start this routine. I know that you don't care."

While the Queen's expression remained the same, her wings buzzed, showing irritation. Or maybe exhaltation. In [i]her[/b] body language, it could mean anything.


"So this is what you want? A world of perfect equinox..."


"All I wanted is to be with my Sister"


Regardless of what you truly is, my hatred for ponykind will [b]never[/b] fade.


"My... My belief is not foolish!" *Celestia hissed, her eyes widening.*

"There is good in ponies, and I refuse to give up on that belief! As long as there is light in the darkness, I will **not** give up on them!" *She exclaimed.*

"You may hate ponykind, and my love for them will forever be a mystery to you." *The alicorn looked at her with a frown and lowered her voice.* "But to me, you were nothing more than a **monster** at the start."

"I do not seek to change your belief, don't get all fiery on that," Chrysalis waved her foreleg dismissively, and chuckled, "Believe in goodness. That's why I adore you. You're infallible in it, and this is what **draws** me to you."

She glanced mischievously.

"There's nothing more desirable than strength of a character in a person. And yet, if you let me to be feared by them, is it really something bad? Don't subjects need something to be afraid of? So goodness in someone like you can be contrasted and shine even brighter? Be **merciful**, Celestia. Comfort them, when they will be scared by me. See, what I propose?"

*Celestia paused for a moment, mulling over her words.* "... I have considered letting my subjects be afraid of you... And my little Nightmare Night tradition serves this same purpose."

"But I know all too well how terrifying you are to the ponies of Equestria... If you terrorize and scare them, I won't be able to comfort them, love." *She sighed, and her eyes widened.* "And I'm afraid I can't let you terrorize them, not even if you make me fall **more** in love with you."


*Celestia sighed softly, enjoying the sensation of Chrysalis's lips on her skin.*

"Yes, **my love**... I love your darkness..." *She giggled softly, her eyes sparkling with passion.*

"I **love** being opposed to you... **Contrasting** with you..." *She smirked.*

"I do not want a partner that mirrors myself." *She whispered seductively.*

"I want someone who is my **opposite.** And you, my love... **You are everything** that I am **not.**"



"There's **so much** I love about you..." *Celestia whispered, her eyes glinting seductively.*

"We are different, but you are **right.** We are **compatible.** Your **energy** is what I **lack.** Your **brilliance** and **confidence** is what I'm missing."

"I **love** your confidence, and your pride."

*She purred, and snuggled up against the Queen.*

"I **love** your darkness..."

*She nipped at Chrysalis's ear.*


Whiplash:
THEY will never keep Harmony alive.


"I'm so tired."

"


"**Life** is a challenge, after all. It is a constant competition. It is something that your ponies don't seem to truly grasp, don't they?"

"They don't..." _Celestia sighed softly, thinking about her subjects._

"They are naive and they are easily influenced... They follow my rule because they like it that way... They think I know best." _She chuckled._ "I should be **so** stern and harsh for the sake of maintaining order..."

"I don't think they require much to exert order. And you love it this way, don't you? You love them.. manageable."


"No, no, they **don't...**" _Celestia mumbled, still staring at Chrysalis, enraptured by her presence._ "They don't know the meaning of competition..."

"They don't realize that there is glory in **conquering**... They don't realize that by overcoming adversaries and foes, they can **become** something **more**." _Her face flushed a bit as she said that._ "Not in my society, where every one of them has a purpose, Chrysalis. In this gentler place... I wanted to leave things like that for Twilight, for her to decide, what to do with that."

"But what about your purpose, Celestia? 

"What, to feed you?


"But tell me, don't you think that world [b]needs monsters?[/b]"

"The world doesn't need killers, murderers and criminals."

"And yet here we always are, standing up again and again, no matter how hard you try to push us down. Such is nature."

"What are talking about?... Listen to yourself. You celebrate destruction, you revel in sin. Your existence is a fallacy, a consequence of failures in system. Your darkness..." Celestia's voice trailed off. She knew it wasn't the whole truth. 

Chrysalis pressed harder: "So you want to fix me? You want to force your harmony over us all? We will only fight [b]stronger[/b] against it. No, Celestia, see, someone needs to [b]be[/b] a monster. You have so much power, yet you're lacking in strength... Let me be [b]your[/b] monster, so you won't need to become one."

So you want to serve me?

"No, not to [b]serve[/b]," she replied, indignant, "Let me do things that you won't. Let me be everything that you cannot. Let me [b]be[/b] something to be afraid of."

The Solar Princess stared at Chrysalis for a longest time. Then uttered quietly: "Adhesion to the process and admittance of it is no different than direct participation. You seek to corrupt me, to make me like yourself. You want to prove that your point is stronger. You always was about that, about conflict, not cooperation."

"You are the only creature in the entire world I can lend my trust in," Chrysalis slowly traced a hoof on Celestia's cheek, "No, I am not same monster as I was before. Now I [b]am[/b] the Queen of Equestria, aren't I?" She cackled, "Just imagine now, a legion of trained infiltrators and shapeshifters, loyal to you... to [b]us[/b]. A dream for [b]any[/b] ruler, and I grant you it almost [b]free[/b] of charge."

"All you want is for me to close my eyes to your atrocities," the Princess replied in strained voice, "Is that it?"

"I do not require any forgiveness, not from you, not from ponies," Chrysalis pressed her forehead to Celestia's, her wolfish smile widened, "Hate me for that, if you will. I really don't care. You know what I am after... All I want is to remain myself. To be acknowledged by you." She leaned closer, "We can be so [b]powerful[/b] together..."

"It is not power that I am after..." Celestia .

"Naturally, since you have so much to [b]spare[/b]..."

How did it all come to this? Here she was, being seduced by this creature, a known deceiver and a murderer, and yet her rebellious heart wanted something new. A path, not downtrodden. A choice, full of fear and change. 

"[i]Something changed.[/i]" 

"[i]When we are afraid, we are pressing forward anyway,[/i]" she remembered. Oh, little [i]Cadance[/i]...

"I do not believe you," Celestia whispered, "I know that you will try to use me to your own end, that you hate me, and even if you somehow think otherwise right now, your own [i]nature[/i] won't let you to be in peace with me. You will turn on me and betray everything that I am standing for. You would be my downfall, you savage beast."

Chrysalis exhaled sharply, pressing against her, and Celestia moved muzzle to Chrysalis' drooped-down ear.

"The moment you become bored... No... [i]One[/i] misunderstandment is all that would take for you to turn on me, and to revert fully to your wicked ways. You are a creature that sees [i]commitment[/i] itself as a weakness. To depend on another for you is like making a betrayal of yourself. You are a prideful, shortsighted thing."

The Queen chuckled. "So what of it now? What do you want to tell me, demigoddess?"

"I want you to show me your [i]heart[/i]," Celestia spoke in commanding, quiet voice.

They looked at each other starkly, trying to understand each others' true intent. There was pure bewilderment in the Queen's eyes. 

The Princess pressed on: "Show me that there's something in you that truly [i]worth it[/i] for Equestria, as well as for me. Show me that you can [i]try[/i] to follow through with your words and actions."

In a strange moment of weakness, Chrysalis tried to move her muzzle away, but Celestia won't let her, grabbing her chin and locking gaze.

"I know that inside of you there [i]is[/i] capability to create," Celestia said sternly, "I want to see what you can do when your hunger is satisfied. Do you understand me?"

"Do you [i]demand[/i] it of me?" Chrysalis asked nervously, "Do I have to obey you now?"

"I ask you. You are being [i]asked[/i]. For us, for any of this to work—[i]please[/i], Chrysalis. Even if the world has wronged you, show me that you are still capable of caring and loving. Show me your heart."

"You make it sound so droll," Chrysalis cackled, "World did not [b]wronged[/b] me. But, still..." She was silent for a moment, and a pensive expression was on her muzzle. She sighed.



Celestia: "For the world to progress, immortal creatures like me need to dissapear. We are unnatural, we defy logic. This is for the best. We will just hold others back."
Chrysalis против


Following our desires without fear reveals who we are. Am I wrong?


Yes, if you were even slightly less powerfull, I would've killed you...


"All passions die down, eventually."

"All passions die down?" _Celestia muttered, giggling softly._ "How much of a pessimistic monster **were** you, I wonder?"


She turned to changelings, teeth bared, voice demanding:

"All hail Celestia!"

"All hail... All hail..."

Celestia could stop it at any second.


Chrysalis took knee before her, and changelings followed. She knew perfectly well what she is doing. Her green eyes shone with happy, victorious lust.

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

Flash Magnus, pale, removed his helmet, staring wide-eyed.

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

It felt [i]good[/i].

A life of ignorance is one of misery and emptiness, a life spent crying and begging. Even if it is not something one can obtain, a true love of people, a true desire to unite, improve, and enlighten is something we must strive for. To be able to inspire and help others, and to be able to be inspired and helped, this is the way to a life of strength, purpose, and meaning."


"Tell me, Celestia..." The Queen lifted Celestia's muzzle, staring deep into her eyes. The changeling's mane was unkempt. Its green eyes were stark and burned with fiery passion for destruction, with concealed hate, which could be set anew in fire of desire at any moment. It was a pure emotion in equine form. "Tell me," the Queen repeated, "my ancient enemy... When you look at me, what do you see?"

_With their faces so close to eachother's, Celestia could feel the queen's warm breath._
"I... I see a creature so similar to me... So familiar... It's like I can see myself in you."
_The princess couldn't be sure what to answer, but the queen's intense stare was not something she could just ignore by saying nothing._
"You are my reflection, my past. I see what I have become and... and what I never imagined I would ever be. I see my enemy and my lover. My foe and my friend."




Are you ready to take their free will away?

Free will? 

Are you ready to take my free will away?  


Who you are and what you do is entwined...


Don't you want to have a choice? Don't you want to have wants of your own?


Oh, but it is better to see an illusion of benevolent goddess, isn't it?

"Such words are born of pain, pain which turns to hate and anger. And yet, that pain is shared, not just with humanity, but with most life in the galaxy, because we all feel what it is to cry, to suffer, to ache for connection. And to believe that our happiness begins from within ourselves, that is the greatest delusion, as well as the greatest truth. And it can only be achieved by looking inward, toward the source of that pain, that anger, and that hate: Ourselves."


*"Destroyed... and remade..."*

*Celestia opened her eyes. She was looking at the changeling as she spoke.*

*"I must accept that change is inevitable. Sometimes I feel like I never want to change anything, because... because when I was young, when I was young, I had to..."*

*She closed her eyes again.*

*"I had to be strong. I had to be responsible."*

*She took a deep breath.*

"*I had to be like a rock, or a mountain."*


"I know. You went against your nature, and it forced your sister to go away," she weakly giggled, leaning with a shoulder on hers', "Everything was crumbling around, and you had to make your grip on fate stronger... Even when it didn't worked, you couldn't stop being strong... Afraid of letting it go... For their sake... For your sake..."


*"Yes... yes, yes!"*

*She nodded.*

*"For everyone's sake, I... I kept being strong... and I don't know if that was the right thing to do."*

*"I feel so stressed... so exhausted... and I do not know whether I should try to... fix things?"*

*She sighed deeply.*

*"But... is that really something I should do? Try to revert things back to normal?"*

*She took a deep breath and nodded.*

*"It just... it feels like..."*


"So many lives on your conscience, my Queen..." Chrysalis whispered in her ear with closed eyes, "You were **alone** for hundreds of years... Connections made by you were meant only to end, and you abstained from them, tried to find happiness in being happy for others... And it is not enough, doesn't it? Like getting scraps from others' table." She giggled, "Not really befitting for royalty, if you ask me."


*"Yes... yes, yes... no, you are... you are right... I think that was what I was doing."*

*"Everyone would say how grateful they were of me, and I would smile, nod, and thank them for their gratitude... and I would pretend that I was fine. I would pretend that I was happy with what I had."*

*"But, the reality was that... it wasn't enough."*

*"It was never enough for me."*

*"But I couldn't admit it, and I... I couldn't tell anyone."*


"And you wanted to go away, do you remember?" She whispered, "You learned to suffer in silence, because you aren't worthy of their tears... Leave everything to Twilight, to their better chance, to their new future, to an actual ruler..."

"And I took it all away from you. I've intruded and conquered." She looked at Celestia from underneath, with a curious green eye, "What do you feel about it?" 


*"What... what do I feel?"*

*Celestia took a deep breath.*

*"I was... I was afraid that... you will become another nightmare for Equestria just like you were before."*

*"But now? I am... I am confused."*

*"I am confused, and I admit that I do not understand my feelings."*

*"I just... I just feel so... conflicted."*

*"So I cannot say... I cannot say for certain what I feel."*


"Oh." She giggled, "I think being confused and not knowing yourself is **fine**... Do you think I understand myself? My compulsions? Now, that I've become Queen of Equestria, I'm not that certain either. Future... is vague." She was silent for a moment. "And it is okay. We will figure it all out."



*"I... well, I am glad to hear that."*

*"I will be honest with you, I am not used to... sharing my feelings and... speaking about these kinds of things."*

*"In front of all the ponies, I am calm, collected, in control of my emotions... but..."*

*"In front of... someone else, in private, I have... I have no idea who I am. I have no idea what I want."*

*"Am I a leader? Or... or am..."*

*"Or am I something else?"*


"Do you want me to **define** you?" She asked, "What fun in that... You will need to figure it out for yourself... Only thing I can guarantee, is that I would be here for you on every step, my powerful Sun demigoddess. I won't let you fall, because you matter to me." She cackled at her own words, and looked aside, "How ridiculous it all..."



"Do you want me to **define** you?" She asked, "What fun in that... You will need to figure it out for yourself... Only thing I can guarantee, is that I would be here for you on every step, my powerful Sun demigoddess. I won't let you fall, because you matter to me." She cackled at her own words, and looked aside, "How ridiculous it all..."



*Celestia giggled, despite herself.*

"I know... I know..."

*She shook her head and smiled.*

"You're right. I... I need to find myself through my own means. I should not rely on other ponies to define me. I need to know myself, **deep down inside**."

*She sighed and looked at the changeling queen.*

"What I am still confused about is... how do I learn what I want? How do I figure out who I am?"

*She sighed deeply.*


Chrysalis chuckled, "It is something that irks me with you, yes. All I know I am a **monster**, and I do not wish for you to be like me as well. Maybe you should just stop worrying about others and follow your heart to where it will lead you. Be more... yourself..." She nuzzled into her neck, "This warm creature that wants to live..."



*"Hmm... follow my heart... but..."*

*"What if I never knew how to do that? What if I do not have a feeling in my heart of what I want?"*

*"That's what I am trying to figure out, love."*

*She sighed.*

*"I just... I fear that I... I... I am afraid of what I will find if I... if I look into the mirror of my own soul."*

*"What if I do not like what I see?"*


"Do you truly not believe in yourself?" She chuckled, "Being constantly defined by your mistakes and looking into the past is so **plebeian**... Do you truly need to believe in others more than into yourself?... Look there, and I promise you, it will be alright. I know. I've tasted you, and you are most magnificent creature in the world." She traced hoof on Celestia's chest, "Balance is always in simple truths, buried deep under all these complicated meanings and feelings."


"Do you truly not believe in yourself?" She chuckled, "Being constantly defined by your mistakes and looking into the past is so **plebeian**... Do you truly need to believe in others more than into yourself?... Look there, and I promise you, it will be alright. I know. I've tasted you, and you are most magnificent creature in the world." She traced hoof on Celestia's chest, "Balance is always in simple truths, buried deep under all these complicated meanings and feelings."


"I've already told that I cannot define you," she chuckled, "Don't seek an **easy** way out." She fell silent. "I can give you an idea, though. You taste.. sweet. Not too sweet." She buried her muzzle into Celestia's fur, "Like fire, and wind, and lilacs under the sun on the forest opening... Like a river's flow, and the whisper of leaves... Everything will be just fine..."


*Her nuzzling her muzzle into my fur was like taking another step closer. Her words were gentle, they were soothing. Celestia sighed deeply, and closed her eyes.*

"Like... like fire... like wind... like lilacs... like the river's flow... like the whisper of leaves..." *She repeated her words, as she was in a trance.*

*She opened her eyes again, and she looked at the changeling, but she was still lost in her thoughts.*

"This... this is... this is... this is...*nice... it... it feels very... very nice...*"


"Yes. Nice." She was silent for a moment, "You are just a nice pony now. Does that sound... good?"

She glanced from beneath, curiously. "Does that sound enough to begin finding your true self and letting go of the past? To stop silently suffering? I think it is enough, Celestia. Your heart is a good one, it is... powerful."


*Celestia sighed deeply, as if she suddenly felt a great weight being lifted off her shoulders. Her cheeks were a bit red.*

"Yes... it... it does."

*She was quiet for a moment, as if she was reflecting on the changeling's words.*

"I need to look beyond my mistakes. And beyond my own doubts. That is the only way I will know what to do next."

*"If I start looking ahead of myself, instead of back into the past..."*

*"Yes, a good heart..."*


Chrysalis was silent a while longer, staring with unmoving stark eyes. She leaned closer, narrowed them: "Did I help?... **Good**."

She bit Celestia's cheek playfully, and pulled back, giggling: "Now you **owe** me, powerful Sun demigoddess... And don't you forget it..."


*Celestia let out a small giggle, a bit surprised by the changeling's actions as she felt the sensation of the changeling's teeth on her cheeks.*

"Oh, I am aware that I have yet to pay you back for what you've done, changeling."

*She took one of Chrysalis' hooves and gently kissed it.*

"I have not forgotten... and I will not let this favor go to waste... My **beloved**..."


"So you know your place, then..." She was looking with a vehement, promising grin, "Good girl. A bit of honesty does wonders sometimes, doesn't it?"

"My..." she stroke her cheek with a lifted hoof, "...lovely mare. Want to come home? We yet need to rebuild burned-down Palace, I guess..."
