[quote]Inwardly she was like nature, chaotic and irrational. She had no vision into this chaos: it ruled her and swamped her. It sucked her into miasmas, into hurricanes, into caverns of blind suffering.[/quote]

𒄈 [b][size=1.1em]S[/size][/b]he was upside-down, suspended in the dimmed darkness of the royal chambers, tightly wrapped by softly glowing vines of celestial magic to the point of complete immobilization. Her long silken mane streamed down to the several arcane sigils on the floor, which were placed in a pattern that reinforced the containment seal—If Chrysalis could see at the moment, she would've certainly appreciated the effort. Celestia attempted to bound Chrysalis' maw with the rope several times by now, as she did with her eyes, but the creature kept tearing through with her absurdly sharp teeth. It was only putting the integrity of the seal in danger.

"Assuage my thirst, Celestia! I'm [b]sooo[/b] parched..." Chrysalis called in a lustful moaning voice, and made an unexpectedly girly giggle.

She looked like she was having the time of her life, though it had been for a show. With her monstrous appetites, the Queen must've been going through pangs of hunger. Celestia felt satisfaction, knowing that she was driven mad by the fact that her prey remained just out of reach.

"I know that you're here, I can [b]smell[/b] you. I can [b]hear[/b] your breath. You can go if you want..." the Queen playfully whispered, keeping up a wide toothy grin, "I'll just... hang around..." She laughed, "Go, [b]go[/b], Princess! Look after your little ponies! They are so lost out there, in the dark..."

Whatever happens, the Sun must rise on schedule, so the delicate inner workings of the world would remain in balance, however fragile that balance may be. Duty obligated her to place the needs of the world above the needs of the ponies, as the moment Celestia concedes before unfavorable circumstances, she will show genuine weakness in front of anyone who is affected by the presence of her Sun. 'Celestia can be beaten. She is soft and old now, she can be forced to [i]back down[/i],' that's what it would spell in front of the myriads of creatures who are driven by power and ambition, and before long, some other threat will emerge from the shadows, directed at her and those who she loves...

Celestia will never give in to a threat. She drew breath to say something to Chrysalis, but then just smirked. Any attempt to strike conversation with her would be fruitless. All the Changeling Queen understood was the exploitation and subjugation of others, and sadly, Celestia knew how she thinks all too well.

"My dearest marshmallow," Chrysalis called again, still in a breathy whisper, "wanna know what you smell like? You're lilacs and the rye that is heated by sunlight... And yet, you taste like pastilles and regrets..." The beast made a pause, no longer smiling. Her voice was almost dreamy, "How many emotions and feelings are in there, under your pristine skin... How much [b]fire[/b]..."

Celestia quietly sighed, stretching, and poured some water for herself.

"I wonder..." Chrysalis swayed in her binds, biting her lower lip, "Yes, I wonder, what is on your mind right now?... Are you thinking about them, out there? About our little ponies? How you couldn't protect them?" The Queen began smiling again, "How try all you might, you just [i]cannot[/i] protect them from me? From anyone? From [b]anything[/b], really?... That you are [b]not[/b] enough, and never [b]will[/b] be enough?" The monster giggled, pleased by own wit, "Ah, my, this is such a... cursed existence, isn't it?... How it must be... [b]hard[/b] for you, my sweetest demigoddess... To constantly go against the tide, trying to please everyone... to do everything right, while nothing ever can be [b]done[/b] right!" Her laughter became more unhinged, "It is... precious..."

Celestia sat on the floor, rubbing her tired eyes with a foreleg. She toyed with the idea of quelling the noise with a silencing spell, but constant speeches of the Queen meant that she was busy with them and not with escaping. There were also unsavory alternatives for how to cease her ramblings, though Celestia felt no need to lower herself to such unbecoming methods. Maybe [i]later[/i]... She still has [i]dignity[/i].

"I wonder," Chrysalis spoke insistently, still musing, "are ponies thinking the same things about [b]you?[/b] Are they bothered by how they could not protect [b]you?[/b]... Were they [b]ever[/b] been able to protect you?"

"[i]Me?... Protected by ponies?...[/i]" The noble alicorn couldn't help but smile softly. She stood up, leaving the cackling madmare with her caprices.    
   
She went to the balcony, to her small cherished garden of flowers.    
   
"[i]It will be a long day.[/i]"    
   
She gently ran her aura along the petals of a dahlia, just like one would run fingers. She plucked it and adorned her peytral with it, then looked up at the sky. There were unfamiliar stars, just as distant as ever.  

"[i]The longest one yet.[/i]"

[center]═════════════════════════════ 𒀭𒀭𒀭 ═════════════════════════════[/center]

𒄈 [b][size=1.1em]A[/size][/b] marvelous glare of a brilliant dawn draped over the distant horizon, and rays of the Sun glistened all over the dark and lifeless city, melting away the chill of the night. It was a ritual that Celestia witnessed hundreds of thousands of times, but today she allowed herself to soak in the beauty a little longer than usual. Her massive wings flared open, as her mane, carried by the ethereal wind, surged to the heavens. [i]Nothing is over yet[/i], she wanted to tell to her little ponies. [i]Have faith.[/i]

Celestia trained her gaze down, observing. Shadows of the agitated beasts were scurrying on the ground, fleeing from the impending light. Evidently, they were nothing more than insects infesting her cherished city. Celestia's grip tightened on the rail of the balcony as she kept taking in the sight of destruction, all the while noticing more traces of the recent fight—an offensive mockery, a vicious grime that was grinded all over the pure white of the seat of her power. "[i]When it happened last time, I've promised to you that I won't allow you to be hurt this way again, my ponies... Fate doesn't want me to keep promises, it seems. I'll try nonetheless.[/i]"

Celestia turned back to the room with the Queen, who was remaining still in her binds: the catalyst, the perpetrator, the outlier, the [i]monster[/i] that doesn't belong. With the fire reigning inside, Celestia made her way back to Chrysalis. She caught her own reflection in the mirror, and winced: she bore a grim expression, [i]too[/i] infuriated for her own liking. 

"[i]I can't fight the Darkness when I am guided by anger. In equity, I'll find salvation...[/i]" These words did not brought any reassurance, and she wordlessly scowled at the mirror: "[i]But it's not me who requires salvation, and it's not the time to practice self-control. My ponies deserve better.[/i]"

A wave of her horn, and the binds snapped. The Queen, just like a snake that was lying in wait, launched an attack as soon as she hit the ground. Her gaze locked with Celestia's, and the changelings' eyes ignited with insidious witchfire.   
Momentarily overwhelmed, Celestia pushed through the magical attack, taking an unwavering step forward. Then another one. Chrysalis relented and began backing away, crawling like a filthy gaunt spider. Her amused voice became dismayed quickly: "You can [i]resist[/i]? My oh my, don't tell me-" she produced a short unhinged cackle, and growled through clenched teeth: "-back off!" 

Her horn was wrapped by a green aura, but before the Queen could run, Celestia already brought down a hoof on her neck. The pinned changeling still furiously tried to get away, but it only worsened her position, right until she got stuck between the wall and the alicorn in a twisted, painfully uncomfortable pose: overturned and with limbs plastered in all directions. The Queen's breath became fast and shallow. Celestia noticed a rapid pulsation in the beast's chest. So she has a heart after all? Isn't that surprising...

"What are you waiting for?" mustering a grin, Chrysalis casted an absolutely withering glare, "Come on, render judgment upon me if you [b]dare![/b] Give me another self-righteous speech, tell me how I am [b]wrong[/b], how I am an affront to all that is good!" She giggled, "Tell me how ponies managed without you all night long, those [b]miserable[/b], pathetic, little—"

Celestia cut her off: "[i]I[/i] wonder now, if I tear your tongue out, how long will it take to grow it back?"

"Seems, [i]ghhh-k![/i]-" Celestia exerted more pressure on Chrysalis throat, and the beast wriggled under her hoof, clawing at foreleg fruitlessly, barely mustering in strained voice: "-you have... a [b]lifetime[/b]... to figure [b]that[/b] out..."

Celestia stopped suffocating her, and the Queen began breathing greedily, with pale tint on her cheeks. Celestia cocked her head, asking bemusedly: "You are holding out on me. Why? I know that my restrains wouldn't stop you, so don't you want to stop floundering and show me your stolen powers?" She leaned closer, saying in welcoming half-whisper: "Don't you want [i]to fight[/i] me? Where's all you eagerness?"

"Oh-h-h, but I do not want to spoil all the fun..." Chrysalis hissed, mocking her whisper, "My dear, it would be [b]such[/b] a waste to finish it so soon..."

"Is that so? Then we might see eye to eye yet." Celestia shifted her weight back, giving Chrysalis some breathing room. The Queen intended to bide her time, and Celestia could use it to own advantage. She glared into Chrysalis' eyes: "You will remove your pests from my city and its vicinity, you will let me assess and mitigate the damage. I will establish a provisional government to ensure that the city will keep functioning properly. You will not oppose any of further actions of restoring order. You will not let the panic spread in any way. All who you took as prisoner will be released immediately. Your invasion is [i]over[/i]."

"Why... would I let you do... all of that?" Chrysalis licked her lips in anticipation.

"Chrysalis, I am not like you. I do not seek [i]self-indulgence[/i]. I do not find [i]pleasure[/i] in any of this. A need to deal with you is a miserable experience for me, but a necessary one, like for a pony to pay taxes or to deal with mites," she pressed the foreleg down to emphasize own words. The Queen made an abrupt gasp of pain. "I've lived far too long to show mercy to my enemies, and tolerance never was the best of my virtues, but I [i]am[/i] the Princess of Equestria, and I [i]have[/i] to set an example. You survived so far only because of the whims of fate, [i]none[/i] of your victories over me are [i]earned[/i]!" Celestia narrowed her piercing amethyst eyes, "Do you understand me? You've made sure that there's not much to hold me back right now, so please, just [i]try[/i] me again. [i]Defy[/i] me. Give me an excuse to carve out those witch eyes of yours. It will only make a service to the world."

As Chrysalis listened, she was panting fast, becoming agitated. She scowled, refusing to heed: "Acknowledge me before your people, [b]wife[/b], and we may yet strike a d—" she chocked on her disdainful speech, shrieking and turning away from a sudden burst of magic. Celestia's horn burned molten hot. Streaks of fire surged through her mane.

"Have I not been clear?" the solar demigoddess growled with thick smoke quickly evaporating from the corner of her mouth, "No [i]deals[/i]. You will do as I demand or I swear by the stars I'll [i]smear[/i] you on the floor, [i]insect[/i]!"

Celestia wanted to see more of the Queen's dimwitted stubbornness, as it was an [i]excuse[/i] to snap again and presumably postpone the impending longest day indefinitely, since no one will come out from this room alive. Oh, how she [i]wished[/i] for the renegade beast, who was forever at odds with everything, to keep being absolutely untameable. It was what she best at, this [i]chaos[/i]... 

To her mild disappointment, the show of brute force got through to the changeling. The Queen showed restraint, and, after she blinked away tears from hurt eyes, done nothing but watched raptly. She even went limp, and wanly hissed like a deflating balloon: "My, [b]my[b]... You actually smoulder, my Sun..."

"So!?" Celestia demanded an answer, and even more black smoke poured up, "Maybe you just [i]like[/i] the pain?"

The Queen remained almost docile. Her pupils went into thin slits, as she managed to coo with ragged breath: "But how can I not? The pain goes with pleasure, and agony goes with passion. It's all two sides of the same delicious coin~"

"You act [i]juvenile[/i]," Celestia replied coldly, finally reining in her emotions: "All instincts, zero sense. Do as I [i]ask[/i]. You have time until noon. Then you will come to the throne room, so we can speak as rulers and not as savages."

"You make it sound very droll," Chrysalis chuckled.

"Maybe there will be something else if you behave," Celestia replied with a sly smirk.

Chrysalis stared for a moment, seemingly evaluating the risks, and then sighed sharply: "Now [b]that's[/b] promising... [b]Fine.[/b] Have it your way. Go and take care of the ponies," her tail lashed, "I will release your city from my grasp and clean it out from my spawn for your arrival." A wicked grin appeared on her ugly muzzle, "They must've got their [b]fill[/b] by now, anyway."

It felt too easy, but the Queen wasn't giving out the impression that she's lying. Quite contrary, she was filled with mirth and eagerness to cooperate. Celestia was slowly becoming irritated by the sight—if you are forced to play by rules of your enemy, then battlefield is surely [i]lost[/i]. Luckily, she still had several trump cards. "If your intent is to deceive me," she uttered sternly, "then you'd better escape and spare me the trouble of seeing you ever again."

"And to defy fate? How [b]bold[/b]. No, don't you worry, dearest." Chrysalis murmured with a wide grin, "I won't [b]ever[/b] run from what's rightfully [b]mine[/b]."

Celestia stepped back from the changeling, who kept a hungry glare all the way. The silence began to feel awkward for the ancient alicorn. It was supposed to be a victory, and it didn't felt like one at all.

The Princess turned elegantly, walking back to the balcony and distancing from the unnecessary emotions. Her concerns should not be here right now, or rather, [i]definitely[/i] not with the Queen. She outstretched wings, and then hear a peal of laughter from behind.

Chrysalis was shaking. Her laughter was high, abrasive, and miserable. No arrogance or defiant tension remained, just a nerve-racking howl, while she was lying on her side and keeping staring with fiery eyes. When she realized she drew Celestia's attention, Chrysalis lifted her head and uttered in a meticulously quiet whisper: "Lie to [b]me[/b] all you want, but you [b]loved[/b] our talk, don't you, mare? How was my performance?" she took a loud raspy breath, "I know you relished in this feel of [b]power[/b] over me... Was that as good for you as it was for me?"

"[i]I will destroy her. Before the day is done, I will burn her alive.[/i]" Celestia thought grimly. Her reply was deadpan: "Stay and face your doom, the Changeling Queen. I won't grace you with another warning." 

She leaped down from the balcony in a fast flight.

[hr]

In ancient times Celestia witnessed how first gargoyles were created from the intricate fusion of molten lava, rock, and sulfur. A gentle hand pressed crimson rubies into their eye-sockets, and a guiding whisper inhaled life into their still forms: "[i]Exist. Protect. Create.[/i]"

Even when they were granted flesh bodies, the truth that they were originally carved from the stone remained in plain sight, obscured only by different interpretations of the sacred texts, varying points of view, simply failing memory, and stubborn ignorance. Celestia found it very amusing. She was curious about the viewpoint of mortal creatures—how it must [i]feel[/i], she wondered, to look at the mystery and not know a concrete answer to it? They would've strived to discover the solution to the best of their collective ability, but when someone ancient solves the conundrum and gives the easy answer, that mystery will disappear, will it not? When the striving falters, what is there for the mortals to do next? To argue not with each other but with a demigod and with the same ignorant driving force, no less? Can a mortal [i]not[/i] argue? Can you be alive and [i]not[/i] be faced with conflict? Is it really so intrinsic to nature? Or is it the desire for a concrete answer that drives this striving and conflict? Maybe it is a fundamental part of the nature of mortal beings, and it can be both their strength and their downfall...

In any case, gargoyles were excellent craftsmen and unrivaled stoneworkers, so the installation they were involved in was going on splendidly. Most of the project was already done in their realm in the Far West, and the resulting device was brought with great care to the realm of Equestria by the heir to the throne of gargoyles, Prince Scorpan himself. This morning, Celestia met him in the midst of the Throne Room, observing the process. He turned to greet her, and his pale yellow eyes traced over the curious ponies that preferred to remain at the entrance. A black gnarly staff that belonged to the late Lord Sacanas was resting in his firm grip.

"Your Radiance," he uttered with a ceremonial bow.

"Young Prince," she answered with a small, inscrutable smile.

Even while having a beard and gaining a few wrinkles, he still remained a 'young Prince' in her presence. "The world is changing," he said thoughtfully, "but I am pleased that my kin still can be granted passage in the sun-blessed lands."

"While it is imperative nature of the world to change, you will always be a friend to the equine-kind everywhere, young Prince," Celestia barely smirked, "We can do without these formalities. Have respite here with your people, let my rivers wash all your troubles away, taste of my fruit and crops of my land as much as you desire. I insist. All of you have deserved it."

"I wouldn't dare to treat your realm as a resort," Scorpan answered elusively, "The lands of your realm, vast and splendorous, might incite in my men a desire to never leave. We should be wary and abstain from repeating the history of ages past, don't we?"

"Oh, indeed we should," Celestia made a courteous laughter, covering her lips with feathers of a swan-like wing, "So wise of you to look after your subjects... I believe they have enough experience as it is to tell many tall tales for their children at home, who are undoubtedly waiting."

Scorpan returned a weary smile. "We both know that temptation can be a wicked thing. I am glad that you are understanding of our plight."

With pleasantries over, they walked to the exit along the murals, until Scorpan stopped at one of them, inspecting the depicted scene. A black figure with red and white in it was opposing a beige-golden alicorn with pink mane, lunging on the former like a bird of prey.

Scorpan turned to Celestia wordlessly, but there was no need for words.

"I've stricken her name from the records," Celestia replied calmly, "Less connection I have to Nightmare Moon the better, and there's no need for ponies to ever know that she was real. Princess Celestia defeated Lord Tirek alone, for all intents and purposes. One day my sister will be returned to me, and then we will speak of events that really transpired."

"That easy, right?" Scorpan looked again at the sole alicorn on the mural. His grip on the Staff of Sacanas tightened, "Am I correct to assume that Cosmic Council, my Father included, was in support of this?" 

Celestia made a gentle, affirmative nod. A shadow passed over her face. Ever since Tirek's incursion, the Prince must've been in turmoil when he considered diplomatic relations with Equestria...

"I wish he could done the same with Tirek, but even while deprived of the rights to the throne, in the eyes of many he still remains his true progeny and heir," Scorpan spoke impassively, "They began to forget real him, Your Radiance. As strange it is to say, but now they deify his character. His tactics of blind terror are resounded upon the hearts of the youth, and in these troubled times, in his shortsightedness and zealotry they want to see ruthlessness and ambition."

Celestia listened carefully. His words were filled with genuine light-hearted sadness. 

"As decades roll by, and I keep being exposed to their opinions, even I sometimes doubt our predicament and my decisions... We might be not bound with him by blood, and he might be an exile and stubborn fool, but I still love him," Scorpan raised his palm, touching the centaur figure on the mural, "One day he will break free from Tartarus, and if I assist in his demise, I am afraid won't be able to live with it. I won't be able to look into Father's eyes. It is hard as it is, knowing that it was I who brought Tirek to your lands."

"You have much to be proud of, young Prince. You came here with the intentions of peace, to foster friendships and work through the scars of the past. That is true courage. Let me assure you, you did more than enough to atone," Celestia spoke in melodious tone, "so put your mind at ease, as I do not intend to use gargoyle's craft against your dear brother. Providence be willing, we will stop him by other, more merciful means."

"Then why do you need the device?" Scropan spoke quietly, but when he turned, the staff struck against the stone with an insistent echo, "I can't help but see an evil omen in this. What is a threat that might require such measures?"

"It is important to have options," Celestia simply replied, "you know it well."

"That's it?" Scorpan regarded her suspiciously, "Your Radiance, if there anything that might threaten your kingdom in the future, I beseech you, in the name of our long-lasting friendship, let me cooperate with you."

Celestia smiled knowingly. It was easy to consider her a foreteller, especially for an outsider's perspective. "I am not a mare that would bank everything only on one solution. It is unwise and reckless." Her smile grown into a slight smirk, "But I assure you, young Prince, not every of my actions are meant to be considered as a warning by others. I am confident that [i]nothing[/i] here will affect your realm."

Scorpan nodded, acknowledging the real concerns that were behind his inquiries. The realm of the solar demigoddess had always been capable to stand strong against troubles and calamities. Still, Celestia understood the benefits of securing a foothold here, as well as possible prolific alliance. 

It just wasn't in their fate. Scorpan's father, esteemed King Vorak, would've said the same thing.

"I would never doubt any of your words, Your Radiance," Scorpan gave her a solemn look, "However, I feel a need to share more of my worries. It is concerning those wish to follow Tirek." He casted a wary look to his fellow workers, still busy at the far side of the room.

Celestia raised her ear attentively, maintaining the air of her natural grace.

"Your sun-blessed land became something mythical in my realm. Since not all of stone-folk were given longevity, and artifacts and impressions of Equestria are scarce, many began to think that ponies are more dangerous than they are. Most bold ones openly critique me for communing with you. Some think that you enchanted Tirek, led him astray, and that means that your realm-" his voice fell, as he was ashamed by it, "-ripe for conquering... That you, Princess Celestia of the Sun, perhaps bear grudge against us, and might keep Tirek imprisoned by force. There are many unsavory rumors of your land, one wilder than the other..."

"Oh, I see what is this about. Young Prince, you need to tell them what they want to hear," Celestia shrugged with a wing, "that he was seduced by the pony magic. Paint poor Tirek as a martyr, if you will. Let them find common enemy in us."

Scorpan's pale yellow eyes widened, "Your Radiance, I am sorry, did I hear your right?... This act can irrevocably damage all affairs between our nations," urging her to reconsider, Scorpan broke into a fast, nervous speech. Celestia barely frowned. And the boy was giving such a good impression... "What if they come after you? After your ponies? It might be a tide that you will never quench. Militarists, radicals, all who adheres to my brothers' ideals, they might seek [i]revenge[/i]!"

Celestia glanced back at the wall, in middle of reconstruction. "Let them bring their best and dangerous. Let them come." Her smile was as lighthearted as ever.

That was what he truly feared. His voice broke, and his shoulders sagged down in defeat, "I... I [i]suppose[/i], I can discuss the possibility of this course of actions with Father... But..."

Wearing an approving smile, Celestia peeked at the gargoyle royalty from underneath her flowing mane. "Time and time again you prove that you have a conscience befitting for a true ruler, young Prince. Don't let the impending years of your long life tarnish it."

Scorpan pursed his lips. "You flatter me, Your Radiance," he said dryly, "It's not only my conscience that guides me, but my convictions as well, as it should every good person. Your propositions and actions are testing them."

"I am glad you're so open with me," Celestia nodded, pleased that Scorpan's quality of character remained almost same as she remembered, "Believe me, I understand your concerns very well—we share a lot of common ground in regard to our siblings, after all." A hint of sorrow seeped in her voice, "But tell me, young Prince, how do your granddaughters fare? How's your father's health? Tremulous connection between our nations brought to us much ire, true, but a lot of good as well."

"My youngest granddaughter..." Scorpan smiled bleakly in his beard, showing vulnerability, "Believe it or not, Princess, but she asked me to bring her a pony as a present."

Celestia's voice was cheerful and musical, soothing gargoyle's suspicions: "Families, weddings, and the joyous celebrations that come with them—the hearth, the unity, the Harmony, all the simple pleasures of living—that is what we fight for, and our union will not be broken apart by time nor distance. Believe in our cause, young Prince. Believe in the power of love and the strength of our shared values. Our nations may have faced challenges, but they have also given us countless reasons to be proud, and we all strive for a future filled with happiness and prosperity for all. That is our cause." Celestia took a step, beckoning Scorpan, "Come, while we still have time, tell me more about your family. I am eager to hear everything that you have to say."

[center]═════════════════════════════ 𒀭𒀭𒀭 ═════════════════════════════[/center]

𒄈 -[b][size=1.1em]a[/size][/b]diseased moronic beast, carrying within primordial chaos itself, inciting with it panic whenever she went; a marionette of powers that laid far beyond her reach and understanding, knowing nothing but darkness, and how to destroy, consume, and spawn more of her blasted kind—

Fire raged inside her. 

It was inconceivable. 

Something forbidden opened within, and she already forgotten how to properly reign it in. The events of past few days finally accumulated into a blazing crescendo of emotions, and when she flew over her precious city and drank up the sight of its destruction, she landed before the hospital, saw fearful muzzles of surrounding guards that were taken aback by her appearance, and she... 

...she...

...[i]she[/i]...

...cooled her temper. She glanced at the scorched earth underneath her hooves, and continued as if nothing happened: "I require to see Commander Magnus at once."

They were still frightened. "Princess Celestia, Your Majesty, with all due respect, w-we..." one of them suddenly begun stuttering, not being able to bring himself to say it, and another continued:

"As per current instructions, we are required to check all newcomers for possible changelings." 

Even if it was ridiculous, there must be an order, and she is never an exception from it. Celestia nodded, allowing herself to be scanned, speaking loud enough for the whole courtyard to hear: "Do it fast, and bring me Raven Inkwell, majordomo Kibitz, chancellor Cookie Cutter, and lord Buster Brown."

"Your Highness!" Magnus, her good little knight, was already racing to her. He was looking beaten, but none worse for wear. He fell on his knees, bowing, "Your Majesty! You are alright!"

"Report, Knight Commander," Celestia demanded, patiently waiting until unicorns stop weaving their spells. Why are they so sluggish...

"Per latest report, the changelings hold out in the center of the city, while we secured most of it already. We have approximately three hundred soldiers, most of them spread thin to secure chokepoints and . More are arriving from neighboring posts to respond to the emergency, all at your disposal as you see fit..." he stopped speaking, looking upwards. 

Ponies saw how the changelings begun to lazily fly away, just like a dispersed swarm of fat flies that abruptly stopped their feast on a carrion. Celestia felt pang of anger. Ground wasn't offering a good vantage point, but one of pegasus scouts was already hurrying to the ground to acknowledge the fact: "They are retreating!"

Magnus eagerly leaned forward, ready to take wing: "Should we?"

"Our priority is to address the suffered casualties and injures, and ensure safety of our citizens," Celestia turned to group of ponies, hurrying to meet her, "Kibitz, Raven, Buster... Where is the chancellor?"

"Fled, Your Majesty," replied Kibitz with a deep bow.

A thought slipped through the cracks of the porcelain mask: "[i]He'd better to return to Canterlow, or he should start praying to me[/i]." Celestia barely frowned, and immediately responded out loud in ardent and thunderous voice, "Lord Buster, I need of you to cooperate with Royal Guard forces and see to it that medical and rescue teams are ready on standby. We also require to assemble as many construction and rescue workers as possible—within an hour, anyone in Canterlow who is even remotely able-bodied needs to be here and helping."

"Canterlow—the Undercity? The Industrial District?" Buster, the health minister, nervously frowned. It didn't had a good reputation between nobility.

"Captain Gleaming Shield," Magnus turned to one of his subordinates, "assist His Grace in any way you can."

Celestia pressed on: "We need everypony on their hooves. Our goal is to send a message to everyone in the vicinity that the government is still functioning and is in control. Knight Commander, I am ordering a curfew; it goes into effect immediately. Until my explicit order, entry into the city is not allowed to anypony who is not involved in the rescue operations, and anyone who acts suspiciously needs to be checked. See to it that this won't incite panic, since anyone who wants to leave Canterlot without responding to the ongoing emergency should be allowed to do so freely."

"I am afraid that at the moment we are mostly cut off from the outer walls," Magnus replied grimly.

"During the siege the whole platform of our city sank down," Kibitz hurriedly added, but Celestia noted how careful he was with choosing words, "Luckily, it stabilized before we hit the ground."

"As of now, the whole infrastructure seem to be in complete disarray," Raven commented, "In particular, sewage system and electrical grid, Your Highness." 

"Scouts from Wonderbolts also reported the severe flood in the northern part of the city," Magnus finished.

"[i]There is the most scenic and green district, and also the one where administrative buildings are located. If archives, as well as the Town Hall are lost to the flood, then, well... the Equestrian Parlament needs to be restructured anyway,[i]" Celestia was lost in thought for a moment, taking in the new information. "I see," she scoffed out loud, looking upwards at the mountain. Attachment to its rich waterfalls seemed like a great idea during the conception of the city, but now it began to show its ugly sides. 

Still, she believed the position of the platform was approximately like [i]this[/i]. Her horn shone with bright golden, and the ground under everyone's hooves jerked upwards. Ponies lost their breath, completely bewildered. Somewhere nearby a few bricks fell from one of the newer buildings that wasn't built with any kind of seismic activity in mind.

Celestia continued: "We shall see to necessary repairs and renovation in due time," she glanced at Magnus, "As well as pushing forward a project of defensive system for further protection of the city. At the very least, we would need to construct the belltowers. Go on with your duties now."

The veteran of Sombra's war bowed wordlessly in response, stepping back. 

"Your Majesty, what will you say of compensation for our losses and other punitive damages?" a sudden voice called out to her from a gathering crowd.

What [i]gall[/i]. That wasn't what she wanted to hear right now. Celestia identified the outlier in an instant, the Duchess of the Estate of Pudding. Under Celestia's steely glare, the ponies nudged to the sides, letting the Princess to take a good look at the young noble. she went above even wildest expectations, demonstrating complete lack of empathy and ability of reading the room. What does she expect, reparations from Chrysalis? [i]Absurd[/i]. 





Old system took a blow from which it may not recover. If she remains in power, her integrity as a ruler would be challenged in the upcoming months. 'Building' and 'creating' was something far more arduous and effort-inducing than destruction, which Chrysalis so cherished.

If push comes to shove, Celestia might need to abdicate the throne. In whose favor, then? She was the unchanging sovereign for hundreds of years—even Luna's presence was arbitrary in the eyes of the court, of which her little sister was aware and no longer had any objections. To Cadance? Celestia couldn't lay such burden on her... Despite Celestia's best efforts, the girl was still viewed as an outsider in Canterlot, and transition of power would be rocky at best. No, without strong benefactor she will be overwhelmed and deposed by someone more experienced and ruthless. To the Royal Council? That called for a complete restructurization, for which the state was not prepared. In fact, Celestia thought about the members of the Council with sudden cold gut-wrenching dread. They will [i]destroy[/i] Equestria, will drive into the ground everything that she was struggling to achieve for hundreds of years. They will never understand the design, Lord Shorn alone would be enough to leave everything in pieces... Will she leave it to Cadance's little daughter, and leave it with firm instructions in the hooves of the Council? Even if she concocts a fool-proof plan in the span of the day, and will give out the reign publiclly, it was just ridiculous to think about... It would make a target out of Cadance, just as well...

However it would turn out, Celestia could see only strife and dark times ahead. The Princess felt irritated. Twilight was such a perfect choice to resolve all these possible problems in one swift move, an [i]opportunity[/i] for stability in the realm. She was everything that Celestia could ask for, and more. She was young and wise, she would be motivated, she had [i]vision[/i], all the needed connections and charm, as well as wonderful and adaptive mind. If only the girl took the chance and made that decisive blow... Celestia stopped herself. Twilight wasn't some 'girl' anymore, just as Cadance. They were [i]family[/i].

Sadly, in Celestia's experience, family always spelled [i]trouble[/i].

"What am I to do?" She quietly asked Antiquity, "What is the design?"

No answer was there, and no rustling of leaves or promise of guidance. A helplessness washed over her, just like a millennia ago... and then, Celestia laughed to herself. In hindsight, it was amazing that she is still able to experience these strong and and vivid emotions. Lately, only Twilight, Luna, and Sunset were able to spark such feelings in her.

"[i]I'm not done yet.[/i]"



"Your Majesty, if I may inquire, had the Queen been dealt with? Is it over?" Kibitz 

"No." Celestia replied without hesitance, and turned to Magnus: "Spread the word that the Queen is still a threat. No one to approach her if encountered, and not to engage in conversation. She is volatile and highly dangerous."

The commander nodded grimly. "I suppose it can facilitate the evacuation among the most stubborn ones."

Kibitz kept asking "Princess, we can't let her just roam, can we? Can we apprehend her?"

Celestia let a slightest shadow of dissatisfaction cross her muzzle. "No mortal can apprehend her, and no prison is sturdy enough to put her in," she uttered, "Even Tartarus might be destroyed, and I can't risk the integrity of the planes. When time is right, I will face her myself."

Magnus nodded again, but pale expressions of Kibitz and Raven brought cold fury in her heart. They remembered—she [i]knew[/i] it—how she [i]fell[/i] in front of everyone at Cadance's wedding. Celestia put away her real feelings and never vocalized her frustration over this, even in front of Luna. Everyone that night needed a facade that she is all right. She was Sol Invictus, and she wasn't supposed to be defeated so easily... Her pride as alicorn and as monarch was tested.

But it was only the first one in many defeats and setbacks that she [i]needed[/i] to endure in recent years... [i]Such is my burden,[/i] she thought, [i]such is my role. A necessary sacrifice for the greater good[/i]. Still with that in mind, she looked upon the burned city, remembered the expression of terror in Twilight's face... She sighed, thinking about the changed stars. 


"Cadance said that Prince Shining was killed while he tried to protect her from changelings."

"Twilight... "



"From where even comes all this pride, all this shortsightedness?"


Duchess of the Pudding Estate


Cookie Cutter

"He perished while he tried protecting her, m'lady."

"My poor Candlelight..."



I have to give credit to you, it's far more easier to break someone who is running from themselves.


"Celestia, don't hold back on me. We are all just talking animals..."

What can be more pleasing than the act of creation?



She gave an unpleasant smirk.

"What's wrong with chasing your dreams, Celestia?" Chrysalis smiled, "And I'm being serious--what's [b]wrong[/b] with that?"

You act as if you are bold and daring


Being the Queen of Equestria is the last thing you would want. You revel in the freedom of not trying to conforming.

I will redefine everything to my liking.

You know it won't work... You will destroy the realm, doom everyone.

And you would hate that, won't you, wife?...

She appreciated that Scorpan wasn't insistent about it.

Is he a prisoner of ponies? 




"My sun-blessed land might have such effect," Celestia smiled warmly, "Perhaps you should visit it more often, and let your worries wash away in the waters of" She spread her snow-white wing, stretching it to the sky. Her smile was a tiny bit crooked. 

"I wouldn't dare to treat your realm as some resort," the gargoyle Prince frowned, "By the providence's will,  "

"Oh? You can tell me as it is, Prince. You worry a lot more about the fate of your brother."



He was far more theatrical about all

"You know that I understand your plight like no one other in this world,"



Conscience 

Scorpan was one of the few who could understand her plight.

He still was guilty after Lord Tirek's incursion.



"Your Majesty, I have to ask," he sighed defeatedly, "Is there a threat in a foreseeable future?"

The question that he really wanted to ask hanged in the air. Scorpan was worried if he just lent a hand in possible demise of his estranged brother, should he reemerge during these . Celestia knew she could relate to these concerns... 

It might've been the only reason why their acquaitance lasted centuries as it is.

"It's not that severe," Celestia was courteous as ever, "It is important to have options, and you know it well."

"Still, you know "

Celestia laughed melodiously, "Not everything is a message or a warning."


"How are your granddaughters fare these days, young Prince?"

"They are fine. Forgive me, Your Majesty. Sometimes I forget with whom I am speaking to."



In that era, Scorpan never came to Equestria again.


"You are struggling even with a simple hornwriting," Celestia offered a vague, thin smile.

"I'll have those who can write [b]for[/b] me, isn't that what a ruler [b]supposed[/b] to do? Besides, all I need is to be better than you, can't be that tough... Oh, I [b]definitely[/b] can become a better Celestia, yes-s-s..." the changelings' eyes happily lit up at this idea, "Just imagine: more [i]perfect[/i] you, more driven you, more [b]bold[/b]-"

"Your boldness only masks your weakness, Chrysalis." Celestia interrupted, listening to the Queen's fantasies calmly.

"-more [i]superior[/i]," Chrysalis laughed, "more beautiful, more [b]divine![/b] Our little ponies would be [b]ecstatic[/b] to have me! With all the vast power of the Sun at my hooftips I'll shine brighter than you ever did, and they would come to their doom like moths to a flame..."

"A creature of the dark such as you would never comprehend the power of the Sun. It is abhorrent to your nature."

"Power is [b]power[/b], it is simple as that."

"And here it is," Celestia's smile grown into a smirk, as she bobbed her head slightly in accordance with own suspicions, "Exactly the monster that I expected to hear, spewing the words of a dirty lowlife thug that you are, a glutton, that is incapable of building and creating, only to mercilessly devour and to have power for the sake of power. Your ways disgust me, Chrysalis."

Chrysalis' gossamer wings trembled in agitation, and she scoffed wickedly: "You, equines, always tend to overcomplicate... For all your talk, it were [b]my[/b] hooves that brought me Equestria with all of its riches, including [b]yourself![/b]" She grinned with vehemence, "Perhaps you require more demonstration of what I am capable of..."

"A demonstration..." Celestia "After all that you've said and done, you still dare to speak such words in my presence. No, you've demonstrated enough. I see what you are clearly.
