[quote]Inwardly she was like nature, chaotic and irrational. She had no vision of this chaos: it ruled her and swamped her. It sucked her into miasmas, into hurricanes, into caverns of blind suffering.[/quote]

𒄈 [b][size=1.1em]T[/size][/b]he little creature was wearing the appearance of one of her guards like a suit. He was looking warily, with a small crooked smile, not trying to hide the nervousness. It didn't helped that he fumbled the papers while he was preparing for its bit, but Celestia wasn't in any hurry right now. She was observing.

He finished collecting the props from the stone floor, stood before her, squeaked, "Uh, do you have an appointment?" and took a hopeful glance.

Celestia didn't budge. She was remembering for whom the form of this pony initially belonged to. If she wasn't mistaken, it was a young sergeant that joined in marriage with his sweetheart just as recent as in past month or so. To her it was something that happened in passing, and was barely worth a glance from a distance, coupled with a warm feeling for happiness for others deep inside. Must've been around that time changelings began to sunk teeth into her city, while she remained none the wiser.

"Let's see, let's see, are you, uh... Princess Twilight Sparkle?" the fake guard stupidly giggled, looking at her, and then tossed a sheet of paper away, "No, she was scheduled for the last night and already [b]left[/b]."

Celestia creased her brow. Is this going somewhere?

"You must be Princess Luna?... No-o," he drawled, "that was the last [b]week[/b], right?"

"You are a clever little donkey, parroting after your mistress, aren't you?" Celestia's eyes blazed up with flames.

"Please," he gulped and giggled again, sweating. "All my act is my own! I only want to know how to present you before the [b]Queen[/b] of Equestria, s'all."

"I see."

She quickly pressed forward, and the little changeling was forced to back up, until he fell through the portal of the Throne Room, losing half of the papers in the process. The fake guard picked himself up and ran through the half-destroyed hall.

Celestia flared her wings and steadied her step, taking in the familiar sight. Everything looked like an explosion went off here recently, and it wasn't the far from the truth. The floor remained cracked and charred, and nothing was left in place of murals and banners, not to speak of other splendor with which the Princess wrapped herself before.  

The velvet carpet that extended across the room had been burned away completely.

The Queen was sprawled on the half-melted throne, not bothered by its sharp edges or the lack of appropriate seat. At her side, a changeling was working with a rasp, trimming her outstretched hindleg, while another one was standing on a stool and fiddling with a giant harp. Surprisingly, he was pulling off not a half-bad job with it.

Lying among scattered sweets, Chrysalis was dozing off, or at least pretending to. She was wearing a midnight blue bathrobe, belonging to Luna. 

"My mistress! The pony Princess have arrived!" the former guard exclaimed in a submissive tone.

Chrysalis lazily opened one eye: "I can see that, [b]fool[/b]." After a mighty yawn, she ignited her horn, and a dish with half-eaten cupcakes had been tossed to the messenger, who began to greedily devour whatever felled from it.

She cruelly pushed away the drone at her hooves, and fluidly sat on the throne to greet Celestia. Her eyes happily glistened, "My S-s-sun," she hissed, pulling on a wide toothy smile, quickly sobering up after a nap. "How is our Canterlot, dearest? Did you had fun out there?"

Celestia ignored the provocation. "So you were busy raiding my pantry and wardrobes?" she asked back, slightly amused.

"Well, I [b]had[/b] to do something while you weren't around, aren't I?" the Queen lamented, playfully pretending to be hurt: "You know, it's [b]rude[/b] to keep your wife waiting... What if I was worrying? It's just too disrespectful to my feelings..." One of the changelings at her side made an abrasive giggle.

"To earn respect you'd better learn how to show it, first," the Princess replied with steel in her voice, regarding the monster in front of her. In the broad daylight Queen Chrysalis was looking especially lanky and ugly, like a moving equine skeleton with messy cobweb of silken hair. 

Chrysalis' smile went even wider. "[b]My[/b], you're so strict... Am I ruffling your feathers, Celestia?" She moved head down, as if trying to cover her features in shadow, and to leave only green shimmering eyes to be seen, "Maybe you'd better show me my place? Make me [b]quiver[/b] under you..."

Celestia smirked, tracing her eyes aside. The changeling drones seemed to be surprised by their Queen's behavior, "You're irredeemable, Chrysalis. If I knew that you're brazenly torturing your prey with bad flirting, I would've destroyed you ages ago just to spare the others."

"No, I don't do it [b]that[/b] often. And what do you mean by [i]bad[/i], anyway?..." the Queen cackled. She propped her chin on a foreleg, and her eyes narrowed into burning, laughing slits, "Usually I just [b]take[/b] what I [b]want[/b], Celestia. I thought I've made that clear."

The alicorn frowned, not entirely grasping why she is even entertaining this conversation. "So am I to consider myself an exception right now?"

Chrysalis gave her a strange look.

For a long moment Celestia stared back, trying to determine the meaning of the Queen's candidness. She was a paradoxical beast, a deceiver and a manipulator, a servant of the Darkness against which Celestia led a war for a millennia, and yet her bluntness wasn't what Celestia expected, and it felt refreshing. Was this a part of her game? Did Chrysalis even cared about that at this point?

What was on her mind?

Visibly flustered, Chrysalis was the first to break eye contact, as if remembering herself.

"You're so irritable. So smug." She rolled on her back and stretched, reaching with forelegs in the alicorn's direction, and then relaxed, letting her limbs flail. "So full of [b]yourself[/b], of this beauty and holiness. How do ponies even tolerate having you around? How can one look at you and do not want to twist your long, precious neck?"

Celestia's eyes flashed in anger, but she quickly composed herself. "You [i]must[/i] be projecting, Chrysalis. Your insolence and blasphemy have gone on long enough. I am here to discuss the current situation in Equestria, not to be personally attacked by some spoiled brat who has nothing better to do than torment those around her."

Chrysalis was enjoying this greatly. "A [i]spoiled brat[/i], am I?" Her voice dropped to a creeping, quiet malicious whisper, "What's wrong with chasing your dreams, Celestia? And I'm being serious—what's [b][i]wrong[/i][/b] with that? What's wrong with having desires and ambitions? So what if I need to break decorum, and a few [b]necks[/b] along the way?"

"[i]You[/i] are thinking you're [i]breaking decorum[/i]!?" Celestia could hardly believe that, "You abolish balance! You're an [i]invading force[/i] that's terrorizing and murdering [i]my ponies[/i]!"

"Again with this whining about ponies..." Chrysalis sat straight and seized Celestia up with a glare, "What is it about your appearance and your docile, servile nature?... It pisses me off, Celestia. It really is. You're slave to them, to your [b]fears[/b], and to your precious [b]destiny[/b] as well. You..." She jerked her head upwards, giving an indignant look, "How can [i]you[/i] be so powerful, you pathetic, broken mare?"

Celestia's face darkened, as she clenched her teeth. "Your words speak of a broken mare, but only you could possibly know what that feels like. I know what you are, you dark, scarred creature. How many times did you need to betray those who trusted you in order to rise to power? How long did you have to struggle to gain the strength that you now greedily hold to yourself, too afraid to spend? I can see right through your empty words, Chrysalis, and I know the truth about you. [i]You[/i] are the slave to your malignant nature, and the one who is broken is you."

Chrysalis made a strange guttural sound, and then burst out in laughter. The alicorn felt uneasy, watching how she was rocking in a completely unrestrained bouts of it. Finally finishing, Chrysalis made a sharp gasp, thoroughly satisfied: "[b]Pr-r-recious[/i]..." she growled like a beast, with sly gleam in her eyes, "You are so serious about all this... I like it. I like it [b]a lot[/b]. What fun we'll have with me as your Queen..."

Celestia snorted. "You are a misguided egoistical savage. Don't tell me that you actually entertain the idea that you can be a ruler equal to me." 

Chrysalis kept grinning: "[b]Please[/b]. If even a subservient gullible creature like you can lead, I would [b]certainly[/b] manage even [b]better[/b]. Some [i]demigoddess[/i] you are..."

Celestia exhaled, trying to compose herself again. "You are struggling even with a simple hornwriting," she offered a vague, thin smile.

"I'll have those who can write [b]for[/b] me, isn't that what a ruler is [b]supposed[/b] to do? Besides, all I need is to be better than you, can't be that tough... Oh, I [b]definitely[/b] can become a better Celestia, yes-s-s..." the changelings' eyes happily lit up at this idea, "Just imagine: more [i]perfect[/i] you, more driven you, more [b]bold[/b]-"

"Your boldness only masks your weakness, Chrysalis." Celestia interrupted, listening to the Queen's fantasies calmly.

"-more [i]superior[/i]," Chrysalis laughed, "more beautiful, more [b]divine![/b] Our little ponies would be [b]ecstatic[/b] to have me! Why, with all the vast power of the Sun at my hooftips I'll shine brighter than you ever did, and they would come to their doom like moths to a flame..."

"A creature of the dark such as you would never comprehend the power of the Sun, let alone wield it. This is abhorrent to your nature." Celestia winced.

"Power is [b]power[/b]." Chrysalis grinned voraciously, "It is simple as that."

"And here it is," Celestia's smile grew into a smirk, as she bobbed her head slightly in accordance with own suspicions, "Exactly the monster that I expected to hear, spewing the words of a dirty lowlife thug that you are, a glutton, that is incapable of building and creating, only to mercilessly devour and to have power for the sake of power. Your ways disgust me, Chrysalis."

Chrysalis' gossamer wings trembled in agitation, and she scoffed wickedly: "You, equines, always tend to overcomplicate... For all your talk, it was [b]mine[/b] hooves that brought me Equestria with all of its riches, including [b]yourself![/b]" She cocked her head, and giggled, "Obviously you are not impressed enough. Do you require more demonstration of what I am capable of?"

[i]A demonstration[/i]?... Was it all about a [i]demonstration[/i] to her? A performance?

"After all you've said and done, you still dare to speak such words in my presence. No, Chrysalis..." Celestia raised her head with horn shining brightly, and saw a startled expression on the muzzle of her enemy, "I think I've heard and seen enough."

The Sun moved a dozen inches across the sky.

The mechanism, that was installed into a circular window far above them, was set in motion with three quick clicks.

The rays raced through the lenses of an amplifier, towards the focal point, that was not unlike a unicorn's horn.

And the Queen burned. 

Most of this room, in fact, in an instant became like an oven, as under Celestia's direction the light reflected through panels, placed beneath the walls. The changelings drones screamed in pain and terror, but their voices were abruptly cut when Celestia waved her horn. Her gaze was focused solely on the Queen.

Chrysalis tried to flee from the burning light, this heated trap that the throne became to her. The prism shifted its focus, the sunbeam followed, and the floor, equally hot, met her with more scorching pain. Celestia caught Chrysalis with aura, bringing down the weight of her magic.

The Queen cried with bestial scream, trying to push against the golden glow, but it was for naught. Celestia reached her, pressed down on the skull with a hoof. Her wings burst open in a towering display of dominance.

"𝐼'𝓁𝓁 𝓅𝓊𝓃𝒾𝓈𝒽 𝓎𝑜𝓊 𝒻𝑜𝓇 𝑒𝓋𝑒𝓇𝓎 𝓈𝒾𝓃𝑔𝓁𝑒 𝓂𝑜𝓂𝑒𝓃𝓉 𝑜𝒻 𝒹𝒾𝓈𝓇𝑒𝓈𝓅𝑒𝒸𝓉, 𝒹𝒾𝓈𝓈𝑒𝓃𝓉, 𝒾𝓃𝓈𝑜𝓁𝑒𝓃𝒸𝑒 𝒶𝓃𝒹 𝒹𝒾𝓈𝑜𝒷𝑒𝒹𝒾𝑒𝓃𝒸𝑒 𝓎𝑜𝓊 𝒽𝒶𝓋𝑒 𝑒𝓋𝑒𝓇 𝓈𝒽𝑜𝓌𝓃 𝓂𝑒."

The Queen writhed like a [i]snake[/i]. The gut-wrenching smell of her burnt flesh hit Celestia's nostrils. The sole eye that was seen, widened in agony and fear.

"𝒴𝑜𝓊 𝒶𝓇𝑒 𝒶𝓃 𝒾𝓃𝓈𝒾𝒹𝒾𝑜𝓊𝓈 𝒸𝒶𝓃𝒸𝑒𝓇 𝓌𝒽𝒾𝒸𝒽 𝓂𝓊𝓈𝓉 𝒷𝑒 𝑒𝓍𝒸𝒾𝓈𝑒𝒹."

She grabbed the Queen's head with her aura, and Chrysalis's scream grew into defiant roar. With a sickening crunch, black blood spluttered over the floor, and the Princess tossed away the twisted, broken horn of the changeling.

"𝒴𝑜𝓊 𝒶𝓇𝑒 𝓃𝑜𝓉𝒽𝒾𝓃𝑔 𝒷𝓊𝓉 𝒶 𝓋𝒾𝓁𝑒, 𝒹𝒾𝓈𝑔𝓊𝓈𝓉𝒾𝓃𝑔 𝒸𝓇𝑒𝒶𝓉𝓊𝓇𝑒, 𝓊𝓃𝒻𝒾𝓉 𝓉𝑜 𝒷𝑒 𝒸𝒶𝓁𝓁𝑒𝒹 𝒶 𝓈𝒶𝓅𝒾𝑒𝓃𝓉 𝒷𝑒𝒾𝓃𝑔. 𝐼 𝓌𝒾𝓁𝓁 𝓃𝑜𝓉 𝒷𝑒 𝓉𝒶𝓀𝑒𝓃 𝒶𝒹𝓋𝒶𝓃𝓉𝒶𝑔𝑒 𝑜𝒻 𝒷𝓎 𝓈𝑜𝓂𝑒 𝒾𝓃𝓈𝑒𝒸𝓉 𝒬𝓊𝑒𝑒𝓃 𝒻𝑜𝓇 𝒽𝑒𝓇 𝑜𝓌𝓃 𝓅𝑒𝓇𝓈𝑜𝓃𝒶𝓁 𝑔𝒶𝒾𝓃, 𝓈𝑒𝓁𝒻𝒾𝓈𝒽, 𝒸𝒶𝓁𝓁𝑜𝓊𝓈, 𝒶𝓃𝒹 𝒸𝓇𝓊𝑒𝓁, 𝒶𝓃𝒹 [b]𝓅𝓇𝑜𝓊𝒹[/b] 𝑜𝒻 𝓌𝒽𝒶𝓉 𝓈𝒽𝑒 𝒾𝓈."

The Queen rolled from underneath the hoof, trying to shield herself from the heat and light. Celestia did not let her, circling and knocking back in the center of the beam. Chrysalis kept screaming, but now there was mad laughter as well, through clenched teeth. "I will... drag you... across all the cities... of your wretched realm!..."

Celestia sneered, looking down at the delusional insectoid, this gnarled beaten mess consisting of nothing but sharp angles, that for some reason crawled up to her and decided she can [i]have[/i] her. "𝒴𝑜𝓊 𝒶𝓁𝓁 𝑒𝑔𝑜, 𝒶𝓃𝒹 𝓌𝑜𝓊𝓃𝒹𝑒𝒹 𝓅𝓇𝒾𝒹𝑒, 𝒶𝓃𝒹 𝓂𝒶𝓁𝒾𝒸𝑒. 𝐹𝓇𝑜𝓂 𝓌𝒽𝑒𝓇𝑒 𝑒𝓋𝑒𝓃 𝒸𝑜𝓂𝑒𝓈 𝒶𝓁𝓁 𝓉𝒽𝒾𝓈 𝓅𝓇𝒾𝒹𝑒, 𝒶𝓁𝓁 𝓉𝒽𝒾𝓈 𝓈𝒽𝑜𝓇𝓉𝓈𝒾𝑔𝒽𝓉𝑒𝒹𝓃𝑒𝓈𝓈? 𝒴𝑜𝓊 𝒽𝒶𝓋𝑒 𝓃𝑜 𝓇𝒾𝑔𝒽𝓉𝓈 𝒽𝑒𝓇𝑒!"

Chrysalis was consumed by utterly psychopathic and deranged laughter. Celestia could see the charred bone showed up from flesh, but even now and in enormous pain, the creature was still refusing to concede or even to lose her consciousness. "I hate..." she spewed, "[b]hate[/b]..."

Celestia's aura kept pushing the Queen down on the sizzling floor. "𝒴𝑜𝓊 𝒶𝓇𝑒 𝓌𝑜𝓇𝓉𝒽𝓁𝑒𝓈𝓈 𝒹𝑒𝑔𝑒𝓃𝑒𝓇𝒶𝓉𝑒, 𝒶 𝓅𝒶𝓇𝒶𝓈𝒾𝓉𝑒, 𝓌𝒽𝑜 𝒸𝒶𝓂𝑒 𝒾𝓃𝓉𝑜 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝒸𝑜𝓊𝓇𝓉 𝑜𝒻 𝒮𝑜𝓁𝒶𝓇 𝒹𝑒𝓂𝒾𝑔𝑜𝒹𝑒𝓈𝓈 𝒶𝓃𝒹 𝒾𝓃 𝒽𝑒𝓇 𝒷𝑜𝓊𝓃𝒹𝓁𝑒𝓈𝓈 𝒶𝓇𝓇𝑜𝑔𝒶𝓃𝒸𝑒 𝓅𝓇𝑒𝓈𝓊𝓂𝑒𝒹 𝓉𝒽𝒶𝓉 𝓈𝒽𝑒 𝒸𝒶𝓃 𝑒𝒶𝓉 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝒮𝓊𝓃 𝒾𝓉𝓈𝑒𝓁𝒻. 𝐻𝑜𝓌 𝒹𝒶𝓇𝑒 𝓎𝑜𝓊. 𝐻𝑜𝓌 𝒹𝒶𝓇𝑒 𝓎𝑜𝓊, 𝓎𝑜𝓊 𝒾𝓃𝓈𝑜𝓁𝑒𝓃𝓉 𝒾𝓃𝓈𝑒𝒸𝓉." Feeling that she is losing herself, Celestia lowered her horn, flaring her wings in a battle stance, "𝐻𝑜𝓌 𝒸𝒶𝓃 𝓎𝑜𝓊 𝑒𝓋𝑒𝓃 𝒹𝒶𝓇𝑒 𝓉𝑜 𝒸𝒽𝒶𝓁𝓁𝑒𝓃𝑔𝑒 𝓂𝑒, 𝒫𝓇𝒾𝓃𝒸𝑒𝓈𝓈 𝒞𝑒𝓁𝑒𝓈𝓉𝒾𝒶, 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝒱𝒶𝓃𝓆𝓊𝒾𝓈𝒽𝑒𝓇 𝑜𝒻 𝒯𝑒𝓇𝓇𝑜𝓇𝓈, 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝒫𝑜𝓃𝓎 𝒬𝓊𝑒𝑒𝓃?"

Chrysalis kept laughing, as even in such condition, she kept trying to stand. "You..." One of her hooves became melded to the floor, and in an enormous effort the Queen tore it clean away. She limply stepped closer, bearing a manic, distorted look. "You... [b]You[/b]..."

"I am not afraid of you, nor your threats." Celestia's horn flared, "All you dark creatures, conniving and devious, are strong only when you're [i]preying[/i] on the weak. You only know how to strike from shadows and to revel in wanton cruelty and in misery of others. You have no strength in my dominion and no advantage over me. Not anymore! For every pony you've killed, you and your kind will repay me tenfold!"

The Queen's voice was sonorous and raspy. "I know what you [b]fear[/b]..." She mustered a snide grin, almost crawling now. Celestia had no intention to back down. "Your ponies... I could've slay them all at any second, just to see pain in your eyes... To savor this pain... To see it, to [b]feel[/b] it. I wanted to crush them, and to get a glimpse of your rage. This... this [b]fire[/b]..." Chrysalis bared her fangs, "I should've [b]smothered[/b] it years ago."

Celestia grasped Chrysalis' jaw and, with controlled telekinetic force, dislodged her teeth in. Chrysalis made a muffled protesting cry, jerking back. When Celestia released the changeling in a moment, the Queen moved her head down, puking up blood and white fragments of her teeth from a broken jaw, which was almost torn apart. She was in shock, shaking with all her body.

"Why my student's spell didn't fixed this?" Celestia growled, narrowing her eyes, "Why? Why!? Why were you [i]allowed[/i] to continue this discrepancy? Why it had gone this far!?" Her voice was becoming more and more loud, "Why were you deemed in the right to commit all those atrocities? Isn't a life of kindness better than a life of hatred and evil? Is love not better than hate? Is peace and harmony not better than suffering and fighting? How can it be that your hateful ideology that revels in sin can be equal to any ideal that seeks to do good? Is it because your ideology gives you [i]pleasure[/i]? Is it because you [i]enjoy[/i] hating? Is it because you [i]enjoy[/i] the suffering of others? [i]How[/i] can your sins be equal to that of good? Is it? [b]Is it!?[/b]"

A deafening silence hung over them, and the alicorn recognized that she was screaming on top of her lungs. All her feelings of betrayal poured out, almost bringing her to tears. It was not how it was [i]supposed[/i] to be... It was [i]unfair[/i] to her.

But the universal laws never were something [i]fair[/i]...

Chrysalis sharply exhaled. All this time she was keeping pushing towards her, and her sudden touch sent cold chills down Celestia's spine. 

"Fine." The Queen murmured with bloody squirts from her mouth. Despite broken jaw, she still was able to speak coherently. "Fine. [b]Fine.[/b] I've no use for your ponies... I do not care about them anymore." She grasped Celestia's neck, looking deep, hateful and longing, into her eyes, bleeding all over her fur. Their chests pushed against one another. "Only [b]you.[/b]"

"What exactly do you mean?" Celestia spoke guarded and stunned.

Chrysalis' torn lips twisted in contempt, and she slowly uttered, giving an impression like this action was bringing her more pain than any of the torture beforehoof: "I won't be hurting them any longer. I [b]promise[/b]."

"What are you trying to tell me? That you won't feed on them? [i]Why[/i]?" the moment she said it, Celestia realized what the answers are. She was freefalling into a deep chasm with no control over it. She [i]needed[/i] to ask it. She [i]needed[/i] to hear it. 

"I've reached deep inside of you..." Chrysalis' voice slithered, "I... I... Can you even imagine how much love I took from you? You [b]can't[/b]. I didn't want to leave you unmolested. I wanted to enslave you. I wanted to [b]win[/b], and I was so close, [b]so[/b] close! I've reached deeper and deeper, and it was like a well that was still going, and going, and [b]going[/b]... Like a cavern... An endless brilliance, full of [b]succulent[/b], magnificent power." Celestia never expected to see Chrysalis being this enchanted. Her gaze wandered beyond the alicorn to something that filled her with reverent awe. "So I've took and took, and I was [b]sated[/b] for the first time in my existence, and you... all [b]you[/b] did was keeping looking at me with those love-stricken eyes... I've drained more than I would ever be able to, and you didn't even noticed. You... the Sun..." She laughed bitterly and pushed muzzles with hers', "You are the most precious and cherished thing to me, demigoddess... I hate it." Her eye flared with baleful green fire, "[b]I hate it[/b]. You've bound me to yourself, and I [b]hate[/b] it! I hate it!!"

Celestia pushed her away, and Chrysalis weakly stumbled, as if in an instant all determination was gone from her. Clutching her disfigured head, she wailed through the bouts of nervous mad laughter, intermingled with crying from her sole remaining eye.

"[i]I can use it,[/i]" a callous thought found its way in Celestia's mind, and she feared this possibility. What had happened didn't changed anything. The Queen was still a threat, and any kind of deal with her is bound to end in disaster.

In fact, the Queen became only more unstable now.

It needed to end soon.

"You're delusional," Celestia spoke quietly, "You lie. You just [i]want[/i] me. You're developing an obsession. You want to leech my divine essence to satisfy your hunger without care for anything else."

Taking a hold of herself, Chrysalis spat a blob of blood on the ground, and snorted, "You'd [b]expect[/b] me to lie, would you, my [b]hateful[/b] nemesis? You pathetic mare... You certainly seem like a type that would appreciate a [b]sweet[/b] fantasy more than any truth." She suddenly engaged in pondering, "Maybe I should've lied. It's what everyone do all the time, after all. Small lies, big lies, self-servient lies, white lies—[b]yes[/b], I could've pretended to be changed to trick you and to play along, to hide mine intentions behind pretty words and worm into your heart..." She cackled, observing the destruction around with a satisfied look, "It would've been so [b]much[/b] easier..."

"I will [i]not[/i] be a meal for you to enjoy." Celestia growled, her ears pulling back.

Chrysalis fixed her eyes on Celestia and hissed, pronouncing with crystal clarity: "I will burn the whole world for your love, Celestia." She paused, seemingly surprised by own words, and gave a devious and bloody grin: "...Oh, [b]wife[/b], my dear, believe me!... I'd [b]absolutely[/b] would. After all, I [b]want[/b] to." 

She took a shaking step closer.

"I [b]want[/b] it to burn." She repeated, "I want [b]this[/b]. I want [b]us[/b], burning [b]with[/b] it. I want to feel alive, to challenge, to conquer and [b]be[/b] conquered. No half-measures. Don't [b]you[/b] want the same?" The Queen leaned closer with an inquisitive glare.

If only for a moment, but Celestia bated breath and listened to how her heart was thumping madly in the ribcage. In some regard, this astute monster was right. The desire of letting go of restraints was tempting her again. Will it now forever be like this?

Ancient memories emerged, and an impossibly long life flashed before her eyes in an instant. 

Celestia exhaled, letting the fumes go through the corner of a mouth, and raised stark gaze back to the Queen. "Show me your power," she demanded, "I want to see what drives you."

"As you wish," Chrysalis giggled, and lowered her head down in an exaggerated, scornful bow, "[b]my[/b] Princess."

It surged from her, and Celestia was forced to shield herself with a wing. She looked down, noticing her hooves scraping against the floor. It was pushing her. The raging magical power bellowed like fire from a furnace, and at the center of it, Celestia saw a figure enveloped in the cloak of all bright colors.  

"[i]Where is the Darkness?[/i]" She thought to herself, squinting and trying to withstand the surge, "[i]Why—what is this, blinding me? How dare she blind me!?[/i]"

"Ah, how I love this..." Chrysalis whispered with malice, "How I [b]hate[/b] this... You have no idea how [b]filled[/b] I am... how... how [b]fed up[/b] I am... by [b]this[/b]... by [b]you[/b]... and all this power, all along, was all here, in [b]this[/b] realm!" The Queen was becoming more maddened by the minute, "This love had [b]blinded[/b] you, didn't it, Celestia? It had made [b]you[/b] weaker... It had made [b]me[/b] stronger!" Her laughter was truly unhinged, "You've become so [b]careless[/b], my ancient nemesis... And now, [b]now[/b], for everything that I've caused is [b]you[/b] to blame, you hear me!? How does it f—"

Wide-eyed, Celestia launched a ray of magic at her. The figure stumbled, clutching her abdomen, and her light swiftly began to recede. With the deceitful visage gone, a painfully familiar beast bared her fractured teeth in a savage, gory grin: "The truth [b]hurts[/b], doesn't it?"

"Stop this nonsense." Celestia frowned, "You are getting carried away. You are at fault of your wrongdoings, and no one else!"

Chrysalis chuckled, still holding her wound. "It was [b]worth[/b] a shot."

So that was the power of the Queen? [i]That[/i] was something that she had stolen from her? It was overwhelming. It was truly [i]dangerous[/i]. Celestia glanced at the bodies of changelings, still strewn around. "You've been replacing my ponies. What have you done to the originals?"

Chrysalis' broken horn fruitlessly sizzled, as she tried to pull one of the dead closer to her. She even bit down her lip in effort. "Well, I don't know, care to manage a [b]guess?[/b]" she scoffed, "Don't you worry, dearest, [b]none[/b] of them were wasted. Their essence helped in my ascension to the throne. You might say, they died for the [b]cause[/b]. What virtue can be higher than [b]that?[/b]" 

Celestia pursed her lips for a moment, and then wordlessly blasted Chrysalis again. The Changeling Queen screamed in anguish, but then quickly recovered, throwing a hateful glare.

Chrysalis crawled to the body of her deceased spawn, and widened her maw, filled with blood and broken teeth. She tore into soft flesh of the stomach of the creature. 

It must've been quite arduous, judging by animalistic growling noises from the Queen, while she was failing to get a better grip with damaged jaw. It was [i]painful[/i] to watch. This savagery had no place in the Throne Room, and yet Celestia didn't intervened, wondering about the [i]nature[/i] of the macabre display.

After Chrysalis managed to wolf down a few bites, she proceeded to tear a hoof from the changeling, gnawing on it while keeping her single eye trained on Celestia.

The alicorn cleared her throat, and her calm voice filled the room with ringing echo: "This is what's going to happen. You will drop any notion of hostility, and I will find a use for you and your minions in [i]my[/i] Equestria. Maybe, in time, when I will break the bind between us, I will come to tolerate your presence, if you manage to prove that there is any worth in it. You will cease calling me your wife, it [i]disgusts[/i] me. The engagement arrangement you've dragged me in is a fictive one, as it was made under duress. I null it."

Chrysalis chuckled. She opened her maw, and the thick saliva with strong natural scent leaked down on the stump on her foreleg. Celestia noticed that the fangs of the Queen almost fully grew anew. "Aren't you a morbid one..." Chrysalis gave a derisive look, sticking the torn hoof in place of her own one, "This is how your idea of negotiating looks like? Threats and ultimatums?"

"I am amazed that you even aware of such words," Celestia stared stonily, "You do not deserve anything else."

"And I am amazed that you presumed your moronic propositions would be acted upon," Chrysalis scoffed, "So you think that you can just geld me and then boss me around? No, you will [b]never[/b] bend me that easily... I refuse, my Celestia. This will [b]never[/b] work."

Silence fell again between them. For nearly a minute Celestia watched how her enemy was replacing her horn next, which then began to transform to accommodate the size—just as twisted as this insectile pegacorn was. There was no doubt that the shapeshifter could regain the lost limbs by other means... It was again a [i]performance[/i], intended for the only witness. 

With the sole fact of own existence, this creature was already [i]asking[/i] to be beat down to a pulp.

Celestia felt an unwavering resolve inside, and embraced it. "There is no choice..." She smirked, "We will settle our differences in battle. You against me, one against one, no intermediaries and no distractions."

"[b]Yes![/b] Yes!" In a rush, Chrysalis abruptly stood up, and flinched, almost falling—the loss of blood must've got to her. "You [b]get[/b] it, do you? Tell me that you're not like those ponies, that you [b]understand[/b] this drive, the desire, the [b]push![/b]"

"The fire..." Celestia felt it under her coat, demanding release, "The demand to stand your ground, whatever the odds. You might be an alien monster, but you [i]share[/i] it."

"This is where the [b]life[/b] is..." Chrysalis chuckled, "This is where the [b]dark[/b] lies. The elation, the power, the [b]struggle[/b]... It's like [b]sex[/b]. You can't pull away from it, and if you do, all you left with are your own thoughts, your emptiness. We all need to fill ourselves with something, don't we?..."

Celestia felt sharp pain inside, a sensation of longing. The feeling of being alive, of being free to move on one's own terms. The [i]chase[/i]... "You will pull no tricks on me." She warned, wrestling the control over herself.

"And where is the fun in [b]that?[/b] No, dearest, we will come at each other with full force. I want to see [b]everything[/b] that you have to offer, all the fire that you have, and I'll give all of mine in return!" Chrysalis scowled, as arrogant as ever, "Promise me that you [b]won't[/b] be holding back, like you did in all past years!"

"Oh?..." The thrill was getting to Celestia. Evidently, this changeling creature could take the heat, couldn't she? Celestia didn't want to pacify herself anymore. Didn't she already done the worst she could? Weren't her ponies hurt? Wasn't the situation [i]dire[/i]?... In sheer spite, she put her hoof down, "No harm shall come to others!"

"I [b]did[/b] said I won't hurt them, didn't I?" Chrysalis rolled her eyes, "But I want everyone to see how I utterly [b]destroy[/b] you, mare, so don't you [b]dare[/b] to run from this city! It all will happen [b]here[/b]."

"They will all see how [i]you[/i] are defeated this time, Queen of the Changelings," Celestia slowly, graciously nodded. "Your threat will end forever, one way or another. You will succumb to me, or die."

The insectoid gritted her teeth in an ardent snarl. A pair of thin wings sprouted from her back, sending across the heated floor droplets of glistening fluid. "When? Now!?"

Yet again, Celestia caught herself almost submitting to the fervor. No, she is not going to be led by these basic, primal compulsions... As painful as it was, but she restrained herself. "Evening. Let it all commence on the evening."

It was funny, how she sounded genuinely displeased. 

But It all was just like in the ages of old. 

It all felt [i]fitting[/i]. 

"I will see that my ponies remain safe, and if you touch them [i]again[/i]..." Celestia's voice deepened, becoming laced with menace, "If I [i]see[/i] that you [i]ever[/i] going back on your word... Nothing will stop me. You won't be saved by [i]anything[/i] from me. I [i]vow[/i] this."

"Responsibilities are such a bore." Chrysalis nervously grinned, "Oh, but I [b]can[/b] understand... [b]Fine![/b] Let's meet on the evening and resolve this once at for all. And don't you [b]dare[/b] be late this time..."

Celestia exhaled. Is this really what they are doing right now? Is this a proper challenge and threat from another ancient creature, from someone who regarded her as a warrior? "Good." The Princess was silent for a moment, and then smiled, "Come with me now, Queen. We have time, so let's take a walk for a while." 

"...Just walk? That's it?" Chrysalis cocked her eyebrow, amused. Even her voice somehow became more mundane.

"Yes. You aren't afraid of [i]just walking[/i] with me, do you?"
