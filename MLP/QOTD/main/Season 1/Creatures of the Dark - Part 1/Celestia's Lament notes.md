A swamp shrouded in fog,
A wolf's howl sweeps over my tracks.
I feel as if drunk—
But I only drank of crystal cold water
From a jug that you brought me,
Seeing me off,
To the road from which I'll never return,
Wait or not, I'll never return...
 
Like a wounded beast,
I'll silently walk over the string.
Believe me, I am not worthy
Of your tears over me,
Of your trailing the tracks
Of droplets of blood, like foxberries in the moss,
To the gates beyond which are coldness and dark,
You know not, only coldness and dark...

Mór scíetan

Þa mære gedimm þam feogere,
Þa geþēot ſwēop min eorþum.
Ic āfand þæt ich ġedruncnode
Buten ich culdra wæterdíyno
Of beorca ðu þe bragtest,
Waciende þam þe me agan.
Ic náwa dugan eftcyme fram mearcpaðas

Ic ſċeal faren þæt rápincel,
Belíefest, ic ne onman luflīċ

Þin þæt þū rincst seall,
Þa ðýra blōda dræpana, efenlæ beriga þe mēos
Æt geat, þurhfærest hit oþ færcyle dimnes,
Þu ne ġecnǣwst, þa færcyle dimnes...

dimnes - darkness

mona: n; moon (weak, masculine)

One day you take in
The tart incense of the Moon.
The knife will shift in the heart,
The pain will arise from the depth,
Do you wait for an embodied bane,
For the spirit of dusky steel,
To let me get drunk off that water again,
Off that heady crystal water, once more?
 
And there's no closing of the ring of hoary hills,
Only the narrow path through the blades of the rain.
Do not search—you won't uncover the tracks,
Which the warrior of heather left in their wake.

Sóna dōgor cymj, þu orpunge
Súr anstór þin Mónan.
Þa ést méce ſticaþ þe heorte
Pīnness ést āhefeþ fram góman.
Þam þe þu ġeset feorhbealu
Cargást þin þēostrast ſtíele
Mihtan ic fordrenċe þone wæter
Þone oristallisone wæter, ednīewan?


Beflīehst trendel þas brantra beorgases
Þéáh ásēċe stángeat þin reġnsċūres fela méceas.
Ne āsēċest—þu næfre āfunde eorþum
Þætte gūþbeorn þin ryge letan wiðæftan.


Do not search—you won't uncover the tracks,
Which the warrior of heather left in their wake.


næfre: adv; never

ne...ne: conj; neither...nor

ne: adv; not

Through the rain's blades the narrow path lies

Ring of the hoary hills has no exit
Only the narrow path through the rain's blades
Do not search—you won't uncover the tracks,
Which the warrior of heather left in their wake.


Note that the word "fela" ("many" ) is used very frequently with partitive genitive nouns.

Because you awaiting the evil
The spirit of dusky steel
Powerful 

Only then you will let me drink up that water
That heady crystal water, once more

Demonstrative Pronoun

Þa and its many meanings

For those struggling to pronounce this, a couple of notes:

The letter þ or "thorn" represents a hard TH sound, as in the word "thing".

The letter ð or "ath" represents a soft TH sound, as in the word "with".

The letter æ simply represents an A sound, as in the word "sat". This is in contrast the letter a, which can represent a variety of sounds in words like "date", "march" or "aid".

The letter ſ is simply an elongated S, and nothing to do with F. It should not be used for capital letters, at the end of a word, or as the second of a double S (so for example, "assets" would be "aſsets", because neither the second nor third S can be written elongated). It looks much better in italics.

Þa can be an adverb that means “when” or “then.” It can also be a plural demonstrative pronoun in the nominative or accusative cases (meaning “those” or “to those”). It can also be a singular feminine demonstrative pronoun in the accusative case. Þa can also be part of the idiomatic expression, for þa þe, which, like for þam þe, means “because.” Use other information in the sentence (for example, the case and gender of the noun to which þa is attached) to help you determine which form of þa is being used in a given sentence. Also, when you come across “îa þa,” you can almost always translate it as ‘then when’.


Sunnan ond mónan þeodcwéne ſwearcunge þurhflon. The queen of sun and moon flew through the darkness
Þa heo dægriman ſawon, þa hie ſe dyſig ſeah. They saw the dawn and the fool saw them.
Dwolman hearra ſæt uppan héahſetle his, cancetende. The lord of chaos sat upon his throne laughing.
