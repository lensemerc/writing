"How much emotions and feelings in there, under your pristine white skin... How much [b]fire[/b]..."


I wonder, what it is about you and your docile, servile nature... It pisses me off, Celestia. It really is. Had you ever had fun?


I can't save them.

"It will be a long day."

She levitated a flower and adorned peytral with it.

"Long day."

Реакция Кибитца и Магнуса на события


"Yes." She said sternly.

"

hateful zeal



Chrysalis is narcissist

"I did sample you, didn't I."



"Is there anything that you want? Anything at all?"


"It is my belief that you should eat what you fear." 
"They served no purpose, lest you enjoyed that your ponies could wander off in the Everfree and to be turned into stone," 

"That means nothing coming from [i]you[/i], you worthless parasite," "Begone."

Начинает уходить, потом поворачивается.
"Is there anything that you want, Celestia? Anything at all?"

Celestia did not expect that. 

"Is there anything that you desire?"

"You know what I want. Peace and Harmony, so it could be spreaded among all."

Chrysalis grinned. "No, no, no... Not talking about [b]that[/b], mare, not about this despicable altruism. What do you want for yourself?"

Celestia is silent.

"Everyone are [b]defined[/b] by their desires, Celestia. They are sole thing that giving us the drive in life. So what it is for you? What lies in your heart, I wonder?" Chrysalis stared at her above the shoulder, and vehemently grinned: "Maybe... Maybe you would want stallions? I can [b]arrange[/b] that..."

Celestia was unmoving, not betraying with even a single muscle her inner state of being. Her cutting voice was filled with promise of danger: "If you expect that I will bare my heart before you, creature, then you are sorely mistaken. No gestures of ostensible goodwill will be enough to amend the rift you caused."

"But I do not seek to amend anything, demigoddess..." Chrysalis grinned, "Let's say it is but a [b]tribute[/b]... Maybe you're just more into mares, with all that longing for your little sister?... Or maybe in your heart of hearts you want [b]all[/b] of your little ponies to worship you more intimately, indiscriminately?..."

Strange acute nature of the shapeshifting beast could led it to latch on every movement that could speak volumes of sheer contempt, rising in the alicorn Princess with every word. Seemingly, Chrysalis was enjoying it nonetheless. Lack of outburst was a reaction enough for her, and so she kept talking slowly, with happy green eyes: "What, not even them, my infallible demigoddess? Maybe you would want to indulge into something more innocent? I can make anything happen, and we could keep it as our personal secret. So, how about small precious colts--"

"How [i]dare[/i] you presume something like [i]that[/i] about me, and disgrace me with your presence?" Celestia stopped holding back. She took a step, her great wings flared. "[i]Get out of my sight,[/i] you [i]mongrel[/i]."



Навещает Филомену, но та отказывается улетать

"Dear Princess Celestia

Today I visited Equestria, and on the one hand, I've learned many wonderous things.

On the other hand, you might say, now I know everything.

See you soon.

Congratulations on your wedding! xoxoxo

Your former student,  
Sunset Shimmer"



"Please, Lady Celestia, let us fight in your stead!"

Целестия смеется. Oh, my little pony... Please, understand that I do not wish to hurt your feelings.


Celestia: "To fight for Equestria it the fate all alicorns resigned to since its inception. Should it fall, and nothing but darkness will follow."


caustic syllables - едкие, язвительные слоги

Turn and face me, Celestia!


"Because everything will end now,"


"Did I ruffle your feathers, Celestia?"

"Let you **be feared** by my subjects?"

*Celestia giggled.* "I'm sure that will turn out just **fine**, love, but I wouldn't want you to waste your abilities **just** on spying. Your changelings are such capable, smart creatures... We should at **least** let them spread love and friendship throughout the land."

"I know you've said that ponies don't interest you, but I'm **sure** that even you would adore the sweet and simple ponies and their silly little traditions." *She whispered.*


"...I'm **glad** to find another soul that understands..." *Celestia mumbled softly.*

"I've been **tired** of seeing everything as so... so... **simple**." *Her eyes widened.* "Ponies don't fight to be better than their neighbor, they don't even fight for what they want. **They are content to stay in their little safe and comfortable routine.** And they call it **happy**."

"I don't want to be happy. I **need** more. I **crave** more. I need to **fight for it!**"

Кибитц, Магнус, и Равен Инквелл жалуются на разрушенную инфраструктуру

_Chrysalis moved higher, kissing passionately, with tongue dancing against Celestia's_ "So tell me..." _she pulled from her and licked lips_ "My tasteful little morsel... Tell me... **Tell me**... How do you want to be taken today?"

"Give me your deepest desire. Whisper your darkest debauchery. Uncover your soul and let me take a glimpse into what you **truly** want."


My sunshine, I love the way you are making me feel..."


In upbeat tempo


"If you seek to claim dominion over my ponies, wouldn't it mean that I get your changelings too?" 

Chrysalis blinked, puzzled. It was something she did not considered. 

Celestia pressed on: "You wouldn't expect that I will allow sentient species to be kept tortured by you? 

Why do you even _care_? Touch them, and I will _destroy_ you, mare. 

Oh, but wouldn't I be in my right to do so? Besides, do you seriously expect you can control each one of them, now? Look at them. How long before they will begin yearning for freedom?


"Because all I see before me is an impudent insect. For all your talk, you yourself is like a child. Flailing at the world, not knowing how it works, and throwing a tantrum when it doesn't cater to your whims. 

Ah, and you would presume that you know how it works, all cooped up in your toy city, judging everyone from far above, high and mighty? That's **rich**. When was the last time you even spoke genuinely with anyone? 

Oh. Looks who's talking... If you think that crawling around in your dirt and darkness gives better view of the world, you sorely mistaken.


"You are a picture of degradation. All you know is how to take, never to give anything in return.

" Stagnate infertile mare,  you don't even have anything to give, " Chrysalis scowled back with vicious passion," All you have going on for you, are looks. "

" Oh, now I know you're being ingenuine..."

Оглядываются. Они окружены огнями. Все спрятались. Делают шаг друг от друга. 

" Look at us, wife, " Chrysalis chuckled, "We are already fighting in front of the kids." 

Celestia rolled her eyes. "I have duties to attend to, so keep it short. Do they have souls or not?" 

"They do." 

"Why?" 

"Why wouldn't they?" 

Celestia examined Chrysalis, frowning. "I need to know for a fact."

"Yes, they have souls. They are capable of everything that your ponies can, and even [b]more[/b]... Jealous, Celestia?"

"Are you trying to compete our species?" Celestia smiled.

"Life is [b]all[/b] about competition."



Вечереет. Все покидают её. Целестия ждет в своей комнате.

"I know, that you are here. Reveal yourself." 

"Neither of us both will survive this," Chrysalis said, her voice thoroughly amused.

Celestia did not graced her with an answer. They both knew that she is completely right.

Chrysalis took a creeping step closer. Her wings fluttered, her ugly muzzle twisted into a passionate scowl: "You want to burn with me, Celestia?..."



It was a fine test of their loyalty.

"Do you question my decisions?"

"Lady Celestia,

"I will never betray my principles, Sir Magnus, nor I will force you to betray yours," she smiled.


"So I slaughtered a couple hundreds of your subjects. So what? You ponies are filled by love, you know how fast you can breed? Well, I mean..." She cackled, "Sure you do. You can't deny that no one will remember them in a few dozens of years..."


"Throw away your dignity. Burn with me."


Целестия посещает место где было уничтожена статуя Дискорда.

"Antiquity?" She repeated again.

There was nothing.

Completely nothing.

Silence.



"Render judgment upon me, Celestia. Burn me!" She laughed, wickedly, "Throw away all your dignity, strike me while I am weak! You might not get other chance!"

"What are you trying to achieve, you creature?" Celestia asked in a powerful demanding voice, "To prove to yourself that I am no [i]better[/i] than you? That I am just as weak, so I would resort to deplorable manipulation tactics? That I've already [i]did[/i] it during my reign?"

"[b]No.[/b]" Chrysalis hissed, "None of that. No. You know..." She uttered with ragged breath, and took a step closer. "Your ponies... I could've murder them all at any second, just to see pain in your eyes... To savor this pain... To see it, [b]feel[/b] it. The moment it all went sideways, I wanted to crush them, and get a glimpse of your rage. Ah, it would be a beautiful fire, my Sun--"

Целестия прижигает её опять, но Кризалис не останавливается. Она кричит от боли, но продолжает ползти, шепча

Сгорает настолько сильно что облезает плоть и видна кость

Целестия смотрит как будто зачарованная. Кризалис добирается до неё, обхватывает шею, и шепчет в лицо про то как не может вытянуть из неё силы
can you even imagine how much love did I took? I've reached deep down, and it was like a well that was still going, and going, and [b]going[/b]. Like a cavern. An endless magnificent brilliance. You are the most precious, cherished thing to me, demigoddess.

Швыряет её спиной на трон

"I hate you," she creaked through the bouts of nervous mad laughter, intermingled with crying from her sole remaining eye, "How I [b]hate[/b] you."


"But you [i]can[/i] take the heat, are you not?"

Про то как они ползают во мраке



"


"You're taste like итп

"I'm curious, now. Are others alicorns demigods too? Your sister? Little Light? Cadenza? I think I would've noticed something the the last one... Interesting..."

[i]Chrysalis won't be leaving Equestria alive.[/i]

"I wonder what you're thinking about now. Do you imagine their screams? Go, take a look. Protect them. I'll just remain here, I [b]promise[/b]. Will be hanging around..."

Хотя Кризалис висит вниз головой, ей похоже безразлично

Короткая стычка когда Целестия снимает повязку с глаз Кризалис. Та пытается достать её глазами, это не получается из-за амулета. Её рог вспыхивает, Целестия выворачивает голову Кризалис и угрожает сломать её рог

Целестия требует Кризалис убрать чейнджлингов, иначе та убьет её

Разговор о том почему она не освободилась

It would be a long day.
Помещает цветок в пейтрал
A longest day.


"This is what is going to happen. You will retract your creatures from the vicinity of the Royal Palace, and you will let me to continue to run the government."

"Why would I listen to you?"

Celestia noted that question weren't asked in combative tone. Chrysalis was genuinely curious, she felt secure. That is good. "I


"I can promise you some fun."

Chrysalis cackled. "Fun? And what fun that would be?"

"I will give you everything that you might've expected from me."

"Sounds delightful." Chrysalis played along, "Will you acknowledge me?"

"That depends if you will [i]behave[/i]."

"Oh, I [b]love[/b] this... And what if I won't?" Her green eyes flared.


"I might carve out those witch-eyes of yours."

Chrysalis began panting faster under her hoof. "Do you now?" She cooed.

"There's not much to hold me back right now, my 'wife'. So please, just [i]give[/i] me another excuse to destroy you." 

Celestia wanted Chrysalis to keep being stubbornly defiant. Oh, she [i]wished[/i] that the beast would show complete lack of any common sense, as well as any capability to relent under pressure. Rest of this blasted day would've been so easy then, as she would've just snapped the Queen's neck and it will be over.

Fate is a cruel thing.

"Well?" Celestia growled, with thick smoke evaporating out of the corner of her mouth. A gentle image of the alicorn Princess was crackling with streaks of fire in her mane, "Don't make me wait, [i]insect[/i]."

Chrysalis was staring wide-eyed, her breathing was slow, rugged: "Oh, you're [b]smouldering![/b] How delightful... You know, you're saying [b]all[/b] the right words, Princess..."

Ready to cast aura, Celestia ignited her horn. The changeling was [i]irritating[/i].

Chrysalis' recognized the intent. She all tensed up under her, and finally caved in: "[b]F-i-i-ine~[/b]," she literally purred, "I'll behave for [b]you[/b]. But it better be worth it."


"You are enjoying it too much."

"[b]Someone[/b] around here must enjoy themselves. In situations like this, you gotta take the most from it, darling wife. You know, when you all strangled, alone in the room, with someone else..." Chrysalis heartly chuckled, "Do you enjoy this? To be such domeneering? Is this what you like, don't you?"


про повер и то что она может освободиться в любой момент



Целестия глубоко поражена и озадачена фактом того что Кризалис может создавать разумную жизнь

These aren't golems, or duplicates. Celestia saw individuals, and realisation stricken her down to the core.

"This is act of creation."

"So?" she shrugged.


"Do you want stallions? Mares? Do you love them young?..."

It is but a shadow of the decadence we can enact, Celestia


"Equestrian Parliament needs to be reorganized anyway," Celestia kept herself in check, not allow to show any dissatisfaction in her voice. Chrysalis's attack on Canterlot made far more damage that she wished to admit. 

Old system took a blow from it could not recover. If she remains in power, her integrity as a ruler would be questioned in the upcoming months. 'Building' and 'creating' was something far more arduous and effort-inducing than destruction, which Chrysalis so cherished.

Dark times were ahead.

[i]It could've been perfect for Twilight[/i], she thought with some irritation. If only the girl made that decisive blow... No. She shouldn't think like that. [I]It's wrong[/i]. She isn't sore loser, and her inner balance will remain unpertrubed. 

What's done is done, and there's no way back now.





Письмо от Сансет вздрагивает в её ауре, сгорает.
Celestia закрывает свое лицо крылом. She was silent, until she whispered guttural, strained:
"Why now?"


You have spunk. I like that.


Несколько чейнджлингов продолжает ходить за Кризалис на отдалении.
"You haven't got rid of all of your pets," noticed Celestia
"So, what of it?" Chrysalis glanced arrogantly "These grubs were spawned not too long ago. They still do not know how affection differs from obedience."
"You mean to tell these ones follow you because they care about you?"
"Precisely that."
"How is the fact that they view you as a mother is bad?"
"Affection can make one act unpredictably. Moreover, it creates a sense of ownership, and I can't have [b]that[/b], can I?... I do not belong to [b]them[/b]. [b]They[/b] belong to me. Do you want your ponies "
There was a point this creature tried to prove to her, Celestia thought. In her cynical approach, she wanted to break down alicorn's beliefs. To test them.


Кризалис появляется из тени в отражении в зеркале. 
As her figure shadowed Celestia's slender frame, the Queen's hoof ran down the curve of the alicorn's delicate muzzle in a sleek, dominant motion. Chrysalis whispered to her, with a demand of passionate fire in her eyes: "Burn with me."

Her hoof went down across Celestia's slender frame, and she whispered in alicorn's ear: 
"Burn with me."

Тогда Целестия разыгрывает свою карту с do you want to become someone? и they are actually sentient

"You can create genuine life."

"Yes."

"Are they capable of higher functioning? Can they read, dream, 

"They can do all that your ponies can do, and more," waved around her foreleg Chrysalis, and then grinned: "Jealous, wife?"

Celestia opened her mouth. Then closed. The Changeling Queen giggled, thoroughly amused.

"Oh, you are [b]something[/b], Celestia... Usually everyone more interested in the fact that I am [b]ending[/b] lives..."


"Does they have souls?"


"Do not worry, you will be safe from her"

"What did you say?"

"You won't hurt them"

"Behave, Chrysalis."

"You won't."



"Look at us, already fighting in front of the kids..."

"You do not amuse me, Chrysalis."

"Want me to create one for you, wife? I'm sure we can manage..."

Celestia scoffed. "Such creature as you shouldn't be allowed to spawn."

"[b]You[/b] will educate me how to be a [b]mother?[/b] That's [b]rich.[/b]"

Идея приходит в голову Кризалис. "You do realise that they are my subjects as well?"

Chrysalis' muzzle fell.

"So, that is correct... If you govern over my ponies now, that does mean that I get your changelings. Call me their Princess now." Celestia pushed forward, "Or better yet, their second Queen."

"Touch them, and your ponies will-"

"[i]What[/i] my ponies will? Come on. Finish that sentence. You want to circumvent your given word already?"

Chrysalis gazed back at changelings with uncertainty. She was being pressed into a corner.

"Now tell me what's with them, lest I'll humiliate you in front of them further," coldly demanded Celestia, "Do they have souls or not?"

"They do."

Celestia's heart skipped a beat, but she remained unfetered. "Was it so difficult to answer?"

Chrysalis' looked back with strange expression. "I like your spunk, Celestia."

"Savor it. That's all you getting."
