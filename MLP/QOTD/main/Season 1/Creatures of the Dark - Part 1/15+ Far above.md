"It will be a long day."

She levitated a flower and adorned peytral with it.

"Long day."

Реакция Кибитца и Магнуса на события


"Yes." She said sternly.

"


"Because everything will end now,"


"Let you **be feared** by my subjects?"

*Celestia giggled.* "I'm sure that will turn out just **fine**, love, but I wouldn't want you to waste your abilities **just** on spying. Your changelings are such capable, smart creatures... We should at **least** let them spread love and friendship throughout the land."

"I know you've said that ponies don't interest you, but I'm **sure** that even you would adore the sweet and simple ponies and their silly little traditions." *She whispered.*



Целестия казуально поправляет просевший город, когда 
Кибитц, Магнус, и Равен Инквелл жалуются на разрушенную инфраструктуру

_Chrysalis moved higher, kissing passionately, with tongue dancing against Celestia's_ "So tell me..." _she pulled from her and licked lips_ "My tasteful little morsel... Tell me... **Tell me**... How do you want to be taken today?"

"Give me your deepest desire. Whisper your darkest debauchery. Uncover your soul and let me take a glimpse into what you **truly** want."


My sunshine, I love the way you are making me feel..."


In upbeat tempo


"If you seek to claim dominion over my ponies, wouldn't it mean that I get your changelings too?" 

Chrysalis blinked, puzzled. It was something she did not considered. 

Celestia pressed on: "You wouldn't expect that I will allow sentient species to be kept tortured by you? 

Why do you even _care_? Touch them, and I will _destroy_ you, mare. 

Oh, but wouldn't I be in my right to do so? Besides, do you seriously expect you can control each one of them, now? Look at them. How long before they will begin yearning for freedom?


"Because all I see before me is an impudent insect. For all your talk, you yourself is like a child. Flailing at the world, not knowing how it works, and throwing a tantrum when it doesn't cater to your whims. 

Ah, and you would presume that you know how it works, all cooped up in your toy city, judging everyone from far above, high and mighty? That's **rich**. When was the last time you even spoke genuinely with anyone? 

If you think that crawling around in your dirt and darkness gives better view of the world, you sorely mistaken


"You are a picture of degradation. All you know is how to take, never to give anything in return.

" Stagnate infertile mare,  you don't even have anything to give, " Chrysalis scowled back with vicious passion," All you have going on for you, are looks. "

" Oh, now I know you're being ingenuine..."

Оглядываются. Они окружены огнями. Все спрятались. Делают шаг друг от друга. 

" Look at us, wife, " Chrysalis chuckled, "We are already fighting in front of the kids." 

Celestia rolled her eyes. "I have duties to attend to, so keep it short. Do they have souls or not?" 

"They do." 

"Why?" 

"Why wouldn't they?" 

Celestia examined Chrysalis, frowning. "I need to know for a fact."

"Yes, they do. They are capable of everything that your ponies can, and even more... Jealous, Celestia?"

"Are you trying to compete our species?" Celestia chuckled.

"What is a life, but a competition?"



Вечереет. Все покидают её. Целестия ждет в своей комнате.

"I know, that you are here. Reveal yourself." 

"Neither of us both will survive this," Chrysalis said, her voice thoroughly amused.

Celestia did not graced her with an answer. They both knew that she is completely right.

Chrysalis took a creeping step closer. Her wings fluttered, her ugly muzzle twisted into a passionate scowl: "You want to burn with me, Celestia?..."



It was a fine test of their loyalty.

"Do you question my decisions?"

"Lady Celestia,

"I will never betray my principles, Sir Magnus, nor I will force you to betray yours," she smiled.


"So I slaughtered a couple hundreds of your subjects. So what? You ponies are filled by love, you know how fast you can breed? Well, I mean..." She cackled, "Sure you do. You can't deny that no one will remember them in a few dozens of years..."


"Throw away your dignity. Burn with me."


Целестия посещает место где было уничтожена статуя Дискорда.

"Antiquity?" She repeated again.

There was nothing.

Completely nothing.

Silence.





Сгорает настолько сильно что облезает плоть и видна кость
"I could murder them all at any second, just to see pain in your eyes...


"But you [i]can[/i] take the heat, are you not?"

Про то как они ползают во мраке



"



"This is what is going to happen. You will retract your creatures from the vicinity of the Royal Palace, and you will let me to continue to run the government."

"Why would I listen to you?"

Celestia noted that question weren't asked in combative tone. Chrysalis was genuinely curious, she felt secure. That is good. "I can promise you some fun."

Chrysalis cackled. "Fun? Oh, I [i]love[/i] this... Fine." Her green eyes flared. "


"I might carve out those witch-eyes of yours."

Chrysalis began panting faster under her hoof. "Do you now?" She cooed.



Короткая стычка когда Целестия снимает повязку с глаз Кризалис. Та пытается достать её глазами, это не получается из-за амулета. Её рог вспыхивает, Целестия выворачивает голову Кризалис и угрожает сломать её рог


Целестия глубоко поражена и озадачена фактом того что Кризалис может создавать разумную жизнь

These aren't golems, or duplicates. Celestia saw individuals, and realisation stricken her down to the core.

"This is act of creation."

"So?" she shrugged.


"Do you want stallions? Mares? Do you love them young?..."

It is but a shadow of the decadence we can enact, Celestia


"Equestrian Parliament needs to be reorganized anyway," Celestia kept herself in check, not showing dissatisfaction in her voice. Chrysalis's attack on Canterlot made far more damage that she wished to admit. 

Old system took a blow from it could not recover. If she remains in power, her integrity as a ruler would be questioned in the upcoming months. 'Building' and 'creating' was something far more arduous and effort-inducing than destruction, which Chrysalis so cherished.

Dark times were ahead.


"Render judgment upon me, Celestia"


Письмо от Сансет вздрагивает в её ауре, сгорает.
Celestia закрывает свое лицо крылом. She was silent, until she whispered guttural, strained:
"Why now?"


You have spunk. I like that.


Несколько чейнджлингов продолжает ходить за Кризалис на отдалении.
"You haven't got rid of all of your pets," noticed Celestia
"So, what of it?" Chrysalis glanced arrogantly "These grubs were spawned not too long ago. They still do not know how affection differs from obedience."
"You mean to tell these ones follow you because they care about you?"
"Precisely that."
"How is the fact that they view you as a mother is bad?"
"Affection can make one act unpredictably. Moreover, it creates a sensation of ownership, and I can't have [b]that[/b], can I?... I do not belong to [b]them[/b]. [b]They[/b] belong to me. Do you want your ponies "
There was a point this creature tried to prove to her, Celestia thought. In her cynical approach, she wanted to break down alicorn's beliefs. To test them.


Кризалис появляется из тени в отражении в зеркале. 
As her figure shadowed Celestia's slender frame, the Queen's hoof ran down the curve of the alicorn's delicate muzzle in a sleek, dominant motion. Chrysalis whispered to her, with a demand of passionate fire in her eyes: "Burn with me."

Her hoof went down across Celestia's slender frame, and she whispered in alicorn's ear: 
"Burn with me."

Тогда Целестия разыгрывает свою карту с do you want to become someone? и they are actually sentient

"You can create genuine life."

"Yes."

"Are they capable of higher functioning? Can they read, dream, 

"They can do all that your ponies can do, and more," waved around her foreleg Chrysalis, and then grinned: "Jealous, wife?"

Celestia opened her mouth. Then closed. The Changeling Queen giggled, thoroughly amused.

"Oh, you are [b]something[/b], Celestia... Usually everyone more interested in the fact that I am [b]ending[/b] lives..."


"Does they have souls?"


"Do not worry, you will be safe from her"

"What did you say?"

"You won't hurt them"

"Behave, Chrysalis."

"You won't."



"Look at us, already fighting in front of the kids..."

"You do not amuse me, Chrysalis."

"Want me to create one for you, wife? I'm sure we can manage..."

Celestia scoffed. "Such creature as you shouldn't be allowed to spawn."

"[b]You[/b] will educate me how to be a [b]mother?[/b] That's [b]rich.[/b]"

Идея приходит в голову Кризалис. "You do realise that they are my subjects as well?"

Chrysalis' muzzle fell.

"So, that is correct... If you govern over my ponies now, that does mean that I get your changelings. Call me their Princess now." Celestia pushed forward, "Or better yet, their second Queen."

"Touch them, and your ponies will-"

"[i]What[/i] my ponies will? Come on. Finish that sentence. You want to circumvent your given word already?"

Chrysalis gazed back at changelings with uncertainty. She was being pressed into a corner.

"Now tell me what's with them, lest I'll humiliate you in front of them further," coldly demanded Celestia, "Do they have souls or not?"

"They do."

Celestia's heart skipped a beat, but she remained unfetered. "Was it so difficult to answer?"

Chrysalis' looked back with strange expression. "I like your spunk, Celestia."

"Savor it. That's all you getting."


посм. материал weak pony ideals

Целестия и Кризалис упираются друг в друга рогами. Ситуация накаляется.

Чейнджлинги называют свои имена, пытаясь разрядить ситуацию

"I will tear you apart, mare."

"[i]You won't.[/i]"

They are mine.

They are mine.
