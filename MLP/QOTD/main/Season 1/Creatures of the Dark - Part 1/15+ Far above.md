"This is what is going to happen. You will retract your creatures from the vicinity of the Royal Palace, and you will let me to continue to run the government."

"Why would I listen to you?"

Celestia noted that question weren't asked in combative tone. Chrysalis was genuinely curious, she felt secure. That is good. "I can promise you some fun."

Chrysalis cackled. "Fun? Oh, I [i]love[/i] this... Fine." Her green eyes flared. "


Короткая стычка когда Целестия снимает повязку с глаз Кризалис. Та пытается достать её глазами, это не получается из-за амулета. Её рог вспыхивает, Целестия выворачивает голову Кризалис и угрожает сломать её рог


Целестия глубоко поражена и озадачена фактом того что Кризалис может создавать разумную жизнь

These aren't golems, or duplicates. Celestia saw individuals, and realisation stricken her down to the core.

"This is act of creation."

"So?" she shrugged.


"Do you want stallions? Mares? Do you love them young?..."


"Equestrian Parliament needs to be reorganized anyway," Celestia kept herself in check, not showing dissatisfaction in her voice. Chrysalis's attack on Canterlot made far more damage that she wished to admit. 

Old system took a blow from it could not recover. If she remains in power, her integrity as a ruler would be questioned in the upcoming months. 'Building' and 'creating' was something far more arduous and effort-inducing than destruction, which Chrysalis so cherished.

Dark times were ahead.


"Render judgment upon me, Celestia"


Письмо от Сансет вздрагивает в её ауре, сгорает.
Celestia закрывает свое лицо крылом. She was silent, until she whispered guttural, strained:
"Why now?"


You have spunk. I like that.
