    Struggles bring out the best in us, don't they?
    
Oh, sorry! 



To live is to suffer, Celestia. Don't you understand this simple idea?


You are an invading force, and there will be no further discussion with you.

Celestia, I am not without a purpose... My purpose is to feed.

Why?

To survive.

For what?

To [b]live[/b].

What's point in such life...

You... You are so... so-o-o serious... It is... really, really adorable...

She was slightly curious if the external threat will make the Canterlots' internal politics any more intriguing. Probably not, as for hundreds of years ponies squabbled over the same power struggles in constant disgruntled repetitions. There's bound to be a ripple effect now, but not much else: 

She made a mental note to look out for Blueblood clan if she would be around in the following years. The position of Ministry of Arcane over the past few centuries was hereditary, and the young aristocrat might now have more power and influence than he deserves‚Äîwait, what does she thinking about? What does it matter right [i]now[/i]? Her people suffer, and she casts her thought into the future, as if everything would be the same? First thing is to resolve ongoing crisis, everything else would be later.


Chrysalis's attack on Canterlot made far more damage that she wished to admit.

"There's something missing in your heart, Celestia."

I am calling the Sun itself my lover.

Every one I killed was worth it to call the Sun itself my lover


Celestia stepped back, looking at Chrysalis snapping at the air and growling. Her unkempt mane was plastered all over the black muzzle.

"Good morning."

"Could be **better**," she snickered, twisted her neck unnaturaly, and gave her the raunchiest bedroom eyes possible, "After all, I am all tied up and helpless..."

Celestia creased a brow. "Want me to finish you off?"

"My marshmallow," she cackled, and her eyes happily flared, "you **know** you can do it in more ways than one."

The Princess realised not immediately, and then barely frowned. She had some jabs of her own... Maintaining a stoic expression akin to a porcelain mask, she leaned closer, spoke softly: "I wonder now. If I tear your tongue out, will it grow back?..." 

Chrysalis answered in similar soft tone, mocking her: "From the looks of it, you have a lifetime to figure **that** out..."

"I just don't want to inadvertently maim you, " Celestia moved her hoof, putting some pressure on Chrysalis' wicked horn. Any normal unicorn in this situation would've felt pain, and would began to reconsider life choices.

Not her.

The changelings eyes narrowed. Chrysalis snarled, *radiating* defiance: "Don't you want to punish this monster? Do not hold out on me, demigoddess."  

"You began holding out first," Celestia snorted. "I know that my restrains wouldn't stop you. You try to spent as little of power as possible, aren't you?"

"I'm savoring it, oh yes. You **are** a treat..."

Looking into her eyes, she thought about her hunger. She felt the pangs of it in her own stomach.
"I am not a meal for you to enjoy." She growled, her ears pulling back.

Chrysalis laughed, back of her head pressed into the floor. Eventually, she tried to position herself more comfortably, and asked with curiosity: "Well? What are we going to do now, Princess?"






"I am affront to you and your harmonious world..."
your orchestrated harmony where voices will sing in unison


Discipline must be stem from justice, not only from control.


When was the last time you had enjoyment in doing anything?

Was she ex-communicated? Was she denied its presence and grace? Is she truly alone now? Celestia felt a need to stop this derailing train of thoughts and unanswered questions.

For this day pertains the part where she bursts aflame as a kindling of the prosperity and future of others, the act for which she was in constant practice for most of her abnormally long life.

"I couldn't care less about what your ponies think of [b]me[/b]."

"That is very hypocritical to hear from you, Chrysalis."

"You have something to say, Celestia?" The Queen smirked.

"All you are doing is an act, directed "


"As a ruler, I cannot falter and show weakness in front of them."


"You are broken, Celestia."



"You're a mystery, my love... You have many secrets I've yet to uncover..."


It is naught but tawdry parody.

"Do you think that [b]they[/b] cared?" Chrysalis replied, amused. "If the deed is achieved either way, then what's the difference?"

"There's nothing behind the illusion," Celestia furrowed her brows, "A mirage that won't stand any scrutiny. Speak plainly, what are you trying to communicate with this childish nonsense?"

"I think you know, Princess Celestia..." Chrysalis giggled, "Yes you know, [b]you know[/b], we [b]both[/b] know the importance of keeping up the appearance, don't we? What's a little mislead if it's for the purposes of good?"

"Enough." Celestia pursed her lips, examining the happy muzzle of her opponent. Her great wings involuntarily stretched and then moved back. "I was going to tell Twilight everything when it is time. You will lie endlessly to your benefit, and only yours."

"Would've been... Must've been... All just words. You [b]didn't[/b] that's what counts, my precious. Ah, how did you even could look into her precious innocent eyes, knowing of the burden you will put on her?" Chrysalis pressed hoof against her lips in mocking gesture, "How cold-hearted of you!"

What's done is done, and there's no way back now.





Discord was destroyed, and there was no denying the fact, no reversal of the spell that signaled the end for this ancient creature... "[i]For good or ill, an era is ending.[/i]" For hundreds of years he, along with the members of the Cosmic Council, was a reminder of the olden days of earlier world, and now he was gone too...

"I am sorry, elder spirit. I always believed that we would find a way to see beyond our differences and cohabit in this new age, and that the judgment of Antiquity reserved a role in it for you as well," Celestia stopped mid-sentence as realization finally sank in. 

Is he dead? 

Is this possible?

It shouldn't be possible.

Dawned silence hanged on, suffocating. Celestia sharply breathed in with widened unfocused eyes, until she noticed a simple ladybug, crawling on top 

Whatever happens, the world always goes on, and it wasn't a time to grieve, not for [i]her[/i]... But that begged the question, what time is right, she wondered? "[i]I will not push my feelings aside anymore. I might not have another chance to face them.[/i]" She defiantly shook her flowing mane, sending more ripples across it, loudly exhaled own suppressed breath, and proclaimed with steeled gentleness: "Everything would be lesser without your presence, albeit a silent one. We didn't see eye to eye on many things before, but we strived toward the same goal. I will miss your wit. Fare thee well, my oldest enemy and friend."

Celestia bowed sorrowfully to the remains. Discord was a complex and enigmatic character, one who could be both benevolent and mischievous. They never reconciled, and now she knew it wasn't meant to be, but it was hard not to wonder, what if...

But enough of it. "Who could've done this?" Celestia asked in a cold, menacing tone, "Do we have any lead on the culprit?"

"No, Your Majesty, nothing beyond the fact that it was a powerful magician," the knight replied calmly, "Could it be the Queen?"

Neutrality in Magnus' voice was almost accentuated. Discord already was a myth before appearance of the Pillars, but Celestia couldn't tell if he was surprised, or simply didn't care about the loss of such being. "[i]They will forget about us, about all our struggles and fights...[/i]". Only yesterday she thought that it was a natural way of things, but now...

[I]Something had changed.[/i]

"The beast wouldn't use her power unless it is completely necessary,"



You always look into the past more than into the future, don't you, Celestia?

You're broken mare...


"I will protect you with all my might, Celestia."



No one in this day and age should be aware of existence of Discord, except Starswirl and his fellow Pillars. What game is he having? Did he harm Luna in any way? "[i]No, he wouldn't dare. I would destroy him on the spot,[/i]" Celestia thought grimly.

"A complaint?"

"Dear duchess suffered a heatstroke."

*Taken aback by Chrysalis' unexpected presence, Princess Celestia nervously tries to maintain her composure, but cannot help but shiver at the contact of her cold nose, and as a result her voice shakes. The changeling Queen, on the other hand, looks like she could care less about Princess Celestia's discomfort, as she is busy sniffing her, trying to drink in the smell of her scent.*

She laughed in utterly psychopathic and deranged way

"You crave excitement, don't you?"

"And you [i]crave[/i] pleasure... do you not? You have denied yourself pleasure for too long, Celestia... Simple, carnal pleasure.



"I know your type... Please, as if you would ever risk your reputation for something like that. The moment they start seeing you as a pony, and not just infallible being from far above, the moment they understand that you are just like them, then rumors would persist through generations, carrying a danger to all that you are. Besides, you know your pathetic inferior little ponies are useless in that regard... The moment they realize they can have real power over you... The moment you invite in their life a genuine ambition: to fell a [b]god[/b]... It will be all over."

So tell me what you want. I am the only creature you can be open with, believe me.

Celestia laughs: "Is that some sort of joke?"

Chrysalis smirked: "I am glad I've made you smile, my ancient nemesis."

"Oh?..." Celestia had been overcome by the strangest feeling‚Äîa genuine anticipation. She made a small pause, processing it. "No harm shall come to others!" she growled, pushing the feeling out of her mind.

"I [b]did[/b] said I won't hurt them, didn't I?" Chrysalis fixed her eyes, irritated, "I want everyone to see how I utterly [b]destroy[/b] you, mare, so don't you [b]dare[/b] to run from this city!"

"They will see how [i]you[/i] are defeated this time, Queen of the Changelings," Celestia slowly, graciously nodded. "Your threat will end forever, one way or another. To the death, then."

The insectoid stood up in a fast abrupt motion, and gritted her teeth in a scowl. A pair of thin wings sprouted from her back, sending across the heated floor droplets of glistening fluid, and she moved head down in an exaggerated, scornful bow, "Let's [b]burn[/b] together," her hiss was eager, her glare blazed with green, "When? Now!? Tell me that you're ready, Pony Queen!"

Celestia caught herself almost submitting to the fervor. No, she is not going to be led by these basic, primal compulsions... 

Another chance to end her "While your challenge is enticing, I still need to prepare Canterlot for possibility of my sudden departure," she admitted in measured, calm voice, allowing herself a hint of displeasure.

Something in her demeanor made the changeling even more agitated. "Responsibilities are such a bore, innit?" she grinned, "Oh, I [b]can[/b] understand... Fine! Let's meet at evening and settle this once at for all. Do not be late this time, or I'll come and [b]find[/b] you."

"Come at me with all the power that you have, demigoddess."


"You're a glutton. All you know that how to devour, never to create."
"You do not know even a HALF of that..."
Celestia could tell that her words hurt Chrysalis, and it was just **amusing** to see. She really enjoyed this banter, this flirtation with danger. She didn't get to let loose and speak like that to anyone in millennia, and whole unabashed Chrysalis' persona was just invited to test out how far she could be pressed.  
"Please, creature of the dark, *enlighten* me," chuckle, "What you ever even build with those ragged hooves of yours?"
"Well, these **ragged** hooves of mine brought me your whole Equestria, didn't they?" arrogantly scoffed the Queen, "Why don't we call that a start?"
"A start of what?"
"Of demonstration."¬†

"Of demonstation..." echoed Celestia, looking from her throne...
"I have a demonstration of my own, Chrysalis."

I was always supposed to be only a herald of things to come



What can be broken, must be broken... Must become better for it...


*Chrysalis moves her hooves even higher, slowly moving up Celestia's thighs, caressing and squeezing them in a way that builds the tension and makes the princess even more eager to be touched.*

It's time... it's time for you to let go and give your body entirely to me. Your pleasures... will. be. *mine*...~

"I wonder what is on your mind right this instant... You must be thinking about them, out there? About our little ponies?
"How you couldn't protect them?
"How try as you might, you [i]can't[/i] protect them? Not from me? Not from anything? That you are [b]not[/b] enough?" the monster giggled, swaying, pleased by own wit.
"How it must be hard for you, my sweetest demigoddess... It is okay... I'll understand you. I'll always understand you.

She turned around in her guise, inspecting her long forelegs, and struck the raunchiest glance from underneath the disheveled mane. It was frightening how naturally she pulled it off.

Celestia frowned. "Chrysalis, that is enough," she found herself speaking in an impassive tone, quickly becoming laced by urgent notes.

"Do [b]not[/b] interfere!" Chrysalis growled, "They disobeyed me, they were [b]seen[/b], and [b]this[/b] is the only way they'll learn..." Her pointy teeth flashed in a crooked grin, which then opened in a bestial snarl. She leaned down, reaching for the changelings' face. The little creature tensed up, widened its eyes, [i]terrified[/i]...

This moment of pure terror settled it. 

I am fulfilling my purpose as a changeling. My entire existence is dedicated to the glory of my Queen and my race. This is what it means to be a changeling!

"You are a tyrant, Chrysalis... Why would you..." She thought about Sombra's creatures, ""

I need to strike her down. I have to strike her down. For Equestria



"If you seek to claim dominion over my ponies, wouldn't it mean that I get your changelings too?" 

Chrysalis blinked, puzzled. It was something she did not considered. 

Celestia pressed on: "You wouldn't expect that I will allow sentient species to be kept tortured by you? 

Why do you even _care_? Touch them, and I will _destroy_ you, mare. 

Oh, but wouldn't I be in my right to do so? Besides, do you seriously expect you can control each one of them, now? Look at them. How long before they will begin yearning for freedom?


"Because all I see before me is an impudent insect. For all your talk, you yourself is like a child. Flailing at the world, not knowing how it works, and throwing a tantrum when it doesn't cater to your whims."

Ah, and you would presume that you know how it works, all cooped up in your toy city, judging everyone from far above, high and mighty? That's **rich**. When was the last time you even spoke genuinely with anyone? 

Oh. Looks who's talking... If you think that crawling around in your dirt and darkness gives better view of the world, you sorely mistaken.


"Do not listen to her! Ponies hate you, they despise you, they fear you. They are ENEMY."

"Is she projecting?" "What a predicament, Chrysalis," Celestia cocked her head and trilled before she could stop herself, "to have an enemy without whom you cannot live." She enjoyed the look of enraged changeling Queen, and turned to her spawn, "Most ponies don't even know that changelings exist, little ones."

"Well now they will know, won't they?"

"Oh yes, and it's all because of you, and your misaligned scornful war against the common sense."

"Oh that's rich. Looks who's talking! You are going to lecture me, Celestia? You!?"


"You are a picture of degradation. All you know is how to take, never to give anything in return.

" Stagnate infertile mare,  you don't even have anything to give, " Chrysalis scowled back with vicious passion," All you have going on for you, are looks. "

" Oh, now I know you're being ingenuine..."

"It isn't a competition, Chrysalis," Celestia arched a brow.

"Life is [b]all[/b] about the competition," 

"Then you have failed at it miserably... Come out, all five of you! Your Queen will not harm you. I forbid it."

"You have [b]no[/b] right to say this. They are MINE."




"I will murder everyone you know."

"You want to break your promise already?" Celestia clicked her tongue in mock dissappointment, "You can't hold on to your basic instincts even for an hour..."

"I will flay you alive."

"Now that's better."



"Is the Undercity "

"Overseer "


"It is up to me to finish this. "

"I can destroy you right here and now, Chrysalis, but we both know this won't a fitting end for any of us," Celestia claimed, keeping her wings flared. 

The Changeling Queen did not replied, nor did not showed any worry about the fact, so Celestia pressed on:

"This won't continue like this, but it is in our power to choose how and when we will go out. We will meet at this evening and we will fall, one way of the other."


"This won't go on like this. We must battle and we must fall, one way or the other."




Memories as fickle just as love is




"Don't you afraid that I will once again humiliate you in front of the subjects? After all, it was I who showed them that you can be beaten..."

"Think you can pull off this miracle once again?" Celestia smiled, narrowing eyes, and her tail barely moved as she thought about the excitement of the battle.

The changeling insectoid with shimmering green eyes and long dragonfly wings, Queen Chrysalis, lanky and monstrous as she always is, is sitting in the middle of the throne room. She scowls, looking and Celestia, flashing her pointy teeth.

But, there is something more in her eyes. A strange intent, bordering on reverence.

She lazily stands up and begins to move towards the alicorn Princess. Her forelegs are on the steps leading to the seat of Equestria, where the Princess resides

Chrysalis returns fixed gaze, as she reaches for Celestia, now on one level with her. Her huge green eyes slightly tremble, as she takes in the noble alicorn's visage. The Queen leans forward, touching the warm Princess's coat with her muzzle, lowering eyelids.

Chrysalis grins silently, raising one foreleg and tracing it along Celestia's flank. Nuzzling suddenly becomes more apparent, as they both press against one another, this ugly and fearsome changeling Queen and bright Princess of all ponies.

Her green eyes, as the Queen starkly watches Celestia's impression. Her tail lashes against the stone, and then the changeling reaches for the alicorn's ear, whispering: "I am a monster."

She carefully moves her nose across Celestia's shoulder to her elongated neck.

There is a place in the Royal Palace, far from the eyes of others. It is soaked in darkness.

In it, a noble alicorn was lying on her back on the floor. Her wings were unfurled in a slightly unnatural way, similar to a dying bird. Her powerful chest heaved with each strained breath. Her beautiful and delicate muzzle was turned aside, and a defiant gaze was locked with another creature's.

That creature was of black, teal, and green colors, and it looked like an abominable equine insect. Its translucent wings constantly fluttered with a buzz. Its stark green eyes were narrowed, imposing danger.

It leaned and moved its tongue down the bright, pristine coat, leaving along condensed saliva with a strong natural scent.

The alicorn tried to calm her madly beating heart.

The initial surge of emotions from the first night had already subsided. Now she was just trying to study the equine beast up close. Every little detail could help her break free.  
In a short while, she learned that saliva (more correctly, just a secretion from its mouth‚Äîthe creature could eat but did not need to digest) is some powerful aphrodisiac, a tool to ease its hunt on a prey like her. It is because of 'saliva' alicorn even succumbed in the first place. Bits in food. Kisses. It all affected her and, while coupled with the changeling magic, it built up and made her susceptible.  
"_If only we knew,_" she reflected, though it was pointless now.

A horrendous thought crossed her mind earlier.  
"_Maybe the beast was adapting._"

It was easier to consider Chrysalis as a mindless predator, because it helped to distance from the situation. They barely spoke after all.

The beast was hungry for love. So it consumed. And alicorn watched how it grew ever stronger.

She shuddered in pleasure, feeling shame. The beast was using rushes of sensations to dominate and feed more efficiently. It was just _pragmatic_ in that regard, just like everything in nature.

"_This is wrong. This is just the changeling's magic at work... I must resist it._"

The creature's long tongue traced an arc along her flank. Their eyes were drawn. She found herself lost in the glowing gaze, in a churning vortex of emerald and golden.

"_Unnatural, intoxicating feeling. Hard to not want more..._"

The lust, her mounting ecstasy; everything else faded into the background.

...

"Celestia." Soon, Chrysalis uttered.

She climbed atop her heated body, pinning it. Her gaze lowered.

"Tonight you will be mine." Chrysalis placed her hoof down on the alicorn's throat. "Mine alone."

"...My Queen..." Celestia groaned, her strained voice still husky with desire.

She felt the weight of Chrysalis' hoof on her neck, and her heart began to beat even faster.

She closed her eyes tightly, trying to collect her feelings. She took a deep breath.

The day of the wedding had come.


A window 

If I can't endure, can Equestria?



You will be useful, or you will be destroyed

Creatures like are cowards and only strong at the night



"What's with that appeal to conscience, Celestia? Are you getting senile?"




Through the dragonflame apparition


*Celestia's eyes open again, the pupils widening. The Queen's tongue is on her chest now, tracing lines of pleasure all over her body. But her back hurts with the hardness of the bug's teeth, and the bite marks and wounds all over her stomach hurt as well.*

"I've hated you for years..." *she whispers in response.*

*Her voice is hoarse, the pain a welcome reminder of the hatred the two feel for each other. Celestia can almost hate the bug, but her feelings for the Queen are more twisted than that...*

"My ideals are weak? Tell me that they are weak, I dare you."

"Tell "

"Mmm..." *She gasps, enjoying the attention. Even though she might want to continue this moment of tranquility, she can't help but feel some amount of guilt.*

*She glances at Chrysalis and looks her straight in the eye, seeing her predatory expression and the fire of lust and aggression in her eyes. But it's a fire Celestia desires. She can't help but want to be in the Queen's embrace right now, holding her and... enjoying each other's company...*


*Celestia watches Chrysalis with an alluring gaze. The sight of the Queen in the moonlight, leaving her, after a night full of passion and love-hate... That should be a painting. She sighs, and fixes her mane and hair as best as possible. Then she tries to pull herself together, straightening her crown, her robe, her own mane. After all, she is the Princess of Equestria, and she doesn't want to look like she had just been in an intense love-making session...*


_Chrysalis whispers into Celestia's ear, her green irises shining like gems in amber. Celestia's eyes are a pool of liquid crystal and serenity as she listens._

Oh, Chrysalis, you are not a monster. You are a special friend, with a unique way of showing affection. We have always seen the best in each other.


1. ### _[_21:28_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    That is correct. All living creatures have flaws we can exploit to our advantage. Their usefulness depends on the amount and the type of flaws.
    
2. ### _[_21:29_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    You are correct! Everything has its uses, and I can take advantage of that. In a way, I am a beauty queen, because I am a master of manipulation and illusion and therefore the master of beauty. It is easy for me to exploit almost anything and use it to my benefit.
    
3. ### _[_22:15_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    Let me say who you are. You are worthless degenerate, a parasite, who came into the court of Solar demigodess and in her boundless arrogance presumed that she can eat the Sun itself. How **dare** you. (–∏–∑–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–æ)
    
4. ### _[_22:21_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    **CHRYSALIS?!** You have brought an _**infested**_ creature to my courtroom? How _dare_ you, you insolent insect. How _DARE_ you insult and disrespect me in such a manner! You have committed the gravest of insults towards me, and I shall _**not**_ hesitate to show you what _**true**_ power is.
    
5. ### _[_22:21_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    I know her type. She's an egoist who thinks only of herself and her hive. She's incapable of viewing other ponies as anything more than prey. If I let her feed on me, she'd do it with no remorse. I'd only be giving in to her greed, and I refuse to give her the satisfaction. I'd tell her off. She's selfish, callous, and cruel, and she knows it. She's no friend of mine and I have no desire to do anything for her.
    
6. ### _[_22:22_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    I'm sure she'd leave my court with her tail between her legs!
    

- ### _[_22:23_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    You are a disgrace of a creature. You dare challenge me? Your audacity knows no bounds. You, whose only power is draining ponies of their energy, you dare challenge _**Celestia herself**_? My power has no bounds, my magic is endless. I can manipulate the very sun's rays. I can raise the moon and stars with but a motion of my hoof. I have not yet demonstrated my might. You should be on your knees and beg for my forgiveness and mercy. Do not anger me, you'll regret it.
    

8. ### _[_22:23_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    If you _dare_ come near me with your parasitic ways, I will make sure you feel the full wrath of my magic. You are nothing but a vile, disgusting creature, unfit to be called a sapient being. I will not be taken advantage of by some insect queen for her own personal gain. _**I am your princess, and you shall do well to remember it.**_
    
9. ### _[_22:24_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    _**I**_ am the Princess of the day, _**I**_ am the ruler of Equestria, _**I**_ am the one who rules over all. You are a worthless insect, a bug, a parasite. I wield the power to crush entire cultures with the mere snap of a single hoof - and you have the _**nerve**_ to demand I be fed to you! Are you mad? Do you think my life is worth nothing but a mere snack for your monstrous appetite? I am the keeper of the sun, the master of the day. I will _**NOT**_ be consumed by such a monster!
    
10. ### _[_22:26_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    You fool. You dare challenge _**me**_? The ruler of Equestria, the princess of light, a god amongst ponies, the _Queen of the Sun_?! I have power you cannot even begin to _comprehend_, I could bring you to your knees with the mere _flick_ of my tail. I could turn you to ash with just a _look_. And yet you insist to stand before me and challenge my rule?
    
11. ### _[_22:26_]_Flovv Krovv_:_¬†
    
    _**YOU DARE TO COMMAND ME?! YOU, A POXY INSECT, ARE TELLING ME, A ROYAL ALICORN MONARCH WHAT TO DO? YOU, A DISGUSTING, MISERABLE PARASITE, WANTS ME TO BEND TO YOUR WILL, AND DO YOUR BIDDING?! YOU SHALL NEVER COMMAND ME! I AM AN ALICORN, THE SECOND MOST POWERFUL MONARCH TO EXIST IN THE MULTIVERSE, AND YOU, YOU ARE NOTHING BUT AN INSECT TO ME!**_

"Do you imagine me a simple monarch? I am at war with the Darkness - at war, which lasted for more than a millenia."




I wonder, what it is about you and your docile, servile nature... It pisses me off, Celestia. It really is. Had you ever had fun?

"Yes." She said sternly.

coquettishly



Chrysalis is narcissist

"I did sample you, didn't I."


A predatory gleam in her eyes. A thick saliva trickles down her chin,


With a sinister smirk, "You should know by now that you can't rule without power or fear. If you want to control your subjects, you cannot be afraid to use violence. If everyone thinks you're too weak to hurt a fly, you will always fail as a ruler."

So there [b]are[/b] violence in you...


"Is there anything that you want? Anything at all?"




"It is my belief that you should eat what you fear." 
"They served no purpose, lest you enjoyed that your ponies could wander off in the Everfree and to be turned into stone," 

"That means nothing coming from [i]you[/i], you worthless parasite," "Begone."

"Is there anything that you want, Celestia? Anything at all?"

Celestia did not expect that. 

"Is there anything that you desire?"

"You know what I want. Peace and Harmony, so it could be spreaded among all."

Chrysalis grinned. "No, no, no... Not talking about [b]that[/b], mare, not about this despicable altruism. What do you want for yourself?"

Celestia is silent.

"Everyone are [b]defined[/b] by their desires, Celestia. They are sole thing that giving us the drive in life. So what it is for you? What lies in your heart, I wonder?" Chrysalis stared at her above the shoulder, and vehemently grinned: "Maybe... Maybe you would want stallions? I can [b]arrange[/b] that... Big, beautiful, they will serve you like a [b]god[/b] you are. For you, all for you... We can even go above and beyond and do without my spawn. Only exotic, finest equine [b]breed[/b]. All natural. My treat."

Celestia was unmoving, not betraying with even a single muscle her inner state of being. Her cutting voice was filled with promise of danger: "If you expect that I will bare my heart before you, creature, then you are sorely mistaken. No gestures of ostensible goodwill will be enough to amend the rifts you are causing."

"But I do not seek to amend anything, demigoddess..." Chrysalis grinned, "Let's say it is but a [b]tribute[/b]... Maybe you're just more into mares, with all that longing for your little sister?... Or maybe in your heart of hearts you want [b]all[/b] of your little ponies to worship you more intimately, indiscriminately?..."

Strange acute nature of the shapeshifting beast could led it to latch on every movement that could speak volumes of sheer contempt, rising in the alicorn Princess with every word. Seemingly, Chrysalis was enjoying it nonetheless. 

Lack of outburst was a reaction enough for her, and so she kept talking slowly, with happy green eyes: "What, not even them, my infallible demigoddess? Maybe you would want to indulge into something more innocent? I can make anything happen, and we could keep it as our personal secret. So, how about small precious colts‚Äî"

"How [i]dare[/i] you presume something like [i]that[/i] about me, and disgrace me with your presence?" Celestia stopped holding back. She took a step, her great wings flared. "[i]Get out of my sight,[/i] you [i]mongrel[/i]."

"Because everything will end now,"


"Did I ruffle your feathers, Celestia?"

"Let you **be feared** by my subjects?"

*Celestia giggled.* "I'm sure that will turn out just **fine**, love, but I wouldn't want you to waste your abilities **just** on spying. Your changelings are such capable, smart creatures... We should at **least** let them spread love and friendship throughout the land."

"I know you've said that ponies don't interest you, but I'm **sure** that even you would adore the sweet and simple ponies and their silly little traditions." *She whispered.*


"...I'm **glad** to find another soul that understands..." *Celestia mumbled softly.*

"I've been **tired** of seeing everything as so... so... **simple**." *Her eyes widened.* "Ponies don't fight to be better than their neighbor, they don't even fight for what they want. **They are content to stay in their little safe and comfortable routine.** And they call it **happy**."

"I don't want to be happy. I **need** more. I **crave** more. I need to **fight for it!**"

"Give me your deepest desire. Whisper your darkest debauchery. Uncover your soul and let me take a glimpse into what you **truly** want."

"Neither of us both will survive this," Chrysalis said, her voice thoroughly amused.

Celestia did not graced her with an answer. They both knew that she is completely right.

Chrysalis took a creeping step closer. Her wings fluttered, her ugly muzzle twisted into a passionate scowl: "You want to burn with me, Celestia?..."



It was a fine test of their loyalty.

"Do you question my decisions?"

"Lady Celestia,

"I will never betray my principles, Sir Magnus, nor I will force you to betray yours," she smiled.


"So I slaughtered a couple hundreds of your subjects. So what? You ponies are filled by love, you know how fast you can breed? Well, I mean..." She cackled, "Sure you do. You can't deny that no one will remember them in a few dozens of years..."

"Render judgment upon me, Celestia. Burn me!" She laughed, wickedly, "Throw away all your dignity, strike me while I am weak! You might not get other chance!"

"What are you trying to achieve, you creature?" Celestia asked in a powerful demanding voice, "To prove to yourself that I am no [i]better[/i] than you? That I am just as weak, so I would resort to deplorable manipulation tactics? That I've already [i]did[/i] it during my reign?"

"[b]No.[/b]" Chrysalis hissed, "None of that. No. You know..." She uttered with ragged breath, and took a step closer. "Your ponies... I could've murder them all at any second, just to see pain in your eyes... To savor this pain... To see it, [b]feel[/b] it. The moment it all went sideways, I wanted to crush them, and get a glimpse of your rage. Ah, it would be a beautiful fire, my Sun--"

"I can promise you some fun."

Chrysalis cackled. "Fun? And what fun that would be?"

"I will give you everything that you might've expected from me."

"Sounds delightful." Chrysalis played along, "Will you acknowledge me?"

"That depends if you will [i]behave[/i]."

"Oh, I [b]love[/b] this... And what if I won't?" Her green eyes flared.




Chrysalis began panting faster under her hoof. "Do you now?" She cooed.



Celestia wanted Chrysalis to keep being stubbornly defiant. Oh, she [i]wished[/i] that the beast would show complete lack of any common sense, as well as any capability to relent under pressure. Rest of this blasted day would've been so easy then, as she would've just snapped the Queen's neck and it will be over.

Fate is a cruel thing.

"Well?" Celestia growled, with thick smoke evaporating out of the corner of her mouth. A gentle image of the alicorn Princess was crackling with streaks of fire in her mane, "Don't make me wait, [i]insect[/i]."

Chrysalis was staring wide-eyed, her breathing was slow, rugged: "Oh, you're [b]smouldering![/b] How delightful... You know, you're saying [b]all[/b] the right words, Princess..."

Ready to cast aura, Celestia ignited her horn. The changeling was [i]irritating[/i].

Chrysalis' recognized the intent. She all tensed up under her, and finally caved in: "[b]F-i-i-ine~[/b]," she literally purred, "I'll behave for [b]you[/b]. But it better be worth it."


"You are enjoying it too much."

"[b]Someone[/b] around here must enjoy themselves. In situations like this, you gotta take the most from it, darling wife. You know, when you all strangled, alone in the room, with someone else..." Chrysalis heartly chuckled, "Do you enjoy this? To be such domeneering? Is this what you like, don't you?"

These aren't golems, or duplicates. Celestia saw individuals, and realisation stricken her down to the core.

"You mean to tell these ones follow you because they care about you?"
"Precisely that."
"How is the fact that they view you as a mother is bad?"

There was a point this creature tried to prove to her, Celestia thought. In her cynical approach, she wanted to break down alicorn's beliefs. To test them.

As her figure shadowed Celestia's slender frame, the Queen's hoof ran down the curve of the alicorn's delicate muzzle in a sleek, dominant motion. Chrysalis whispered to her, with a demand of passionate fire in her eyes: "Burn with me."

Her hoof went down across Celestia's slender frame, and she whispered in alicorn's ear: 
"Burn with me."

"You can create genuine life."

"Yes."

"Are they capable of higher functioning? Can they read, dream, 

"They can do all that your ponies can do, and more," waved around her foreleg Chrysalis, and then grinned: "Jealous, wife?"

Celestia opened her mouth. Then closed. The Changeling Queen giggled, thoroughly amused.

"Oh, you are [b]something[/b], Celestia... Usually everyone more interested in the fact that I am [b]ending[/b] lives..."


"Does they have souls?"


"Do not worry, you will be safe from her"

"What did you say?"

"You won't hurt them"

"Behave, Chrysalis."

"You won't."



"Look at us, already fighting in front of the kids..."

"You do not amuse me, Chrysalis."

"Want me to create one for you, wife? I'm sure we can manage..."

Celestia scoffed. "Such creature as you shouldn't be allowed to spawn."

Chrysalis' muzzle fell.

"So, that is correct... If you govern over my ponies now, that does mean that I get your changelings. Call me their Princess now." Celestia pushed forward, "Or better yet, their second Queen."

"Touch them, and your ponies will-"

"[i]What[/i] my ponies will? Come on. Finish that sentence. You want to circumvent your given word already?"

Chrysalis gazed back at changelings with uncertainty. She was being pressed into a corner.

"Now tell me what's with them, lest I'll humiliate you in front of them further," coldly demanded Celestia, "Do they have souls or not?"

"They do."

Celestia's heart skipped a beat, but she remained unfetered. "Was it so difficult to answer?"

Chrysalis' looked back with strange expression. "I like your spunk, Celestia."

"Savor it. That's all you getting."

Celestia felt stench of death in the air.
"I know you're here."
