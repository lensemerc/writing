The forgotten old place was abandoned for years.

[center]"I will wear your face~...-[/center]

She was being dragged across the stone floor by the leg. Completely undignified. Beaten.

[center]-...they will not even notice you're gone~...-[/center]

On fangs of the creature was her blood. She was drained, used. She couldn't even muster a single spell.

[center]-...your groom will love me, not you~...-[/center]

Her doppleganger looked at her like a distorted reflection. Its singing voice was her own.

[center]-...and when I deal with them, I'll come back for seconds."[/center]

"Someone will save me... Someone will..." She trembled in darkness and cold for what felt like eons, afraid for herself and for others.

Then Twilight suddenly came, and being goaded by the creature, she almost blasted Cadance on sight. Twilight was so furious and on edge, that Cadance managed to prove who she is only through their silly old dance.

And then everything was happily resolved. Her worst day became one of her best. It was an adventure, and they prevailed.

But scars remained.

--

She was living in expectation of grandeur...

Fear. It was something that Cadance was directly struggling with for all of her life. In many respects, love was about managing fear, after all. Fear of expectations, of relations, of responsibility, of trust... Love was just as deep and intricate as fear, and two feelings couldn't be more entwined and be apart of each other at the same time. 

Long ago Cadance had proven her worth by standing against someone who struggled againt fear. 'Prismia' she was called, the old and pitiful hag that lived alone at the outskirts of Cadance's little village. Disillusioned by the world, submerged into loneliness and despair, she tried to do the unthinkable, and leech all love from the others. Cadance, just a little pegasus back then, was the only one who was capable to stand against the hag.

Both of their lives changed dramatically since then, but fight against the fear remained just like before... Burdened with new responsibilities, in time, she mastered the mask that was required of her. Celestia helped her, though inadvertently. For years Cadance expected to shoulder hopes and dreams of the world, but then the other alicorns began to appear and reemerge.

And now the Princess of the Sun herself, that ever looming warm presence above that she knew since foalhood, was trapped with that parasite... She just couldn't stop thinking about her...

"Princess?" the voice called to her, and she snapped out of it.

 Cadance is still fearful of having her whole world turned upside down without a moment's notice. Even if she manages to let her guard down for a few moments, she will always know that it can all very suddenly come crashing down around her again.

"Think I'll go say old Chryssie 'hi' myself,"

"Twilight will manage," she repeated the same thing she told to the girls before, and then felt a sting of conscience. 

"I'll just make sure that she will," her husband smiled warmly, "It'll be easy. One hoof there, and one hoof here, you know how it goes."

"I'm coming with," she said resolutely.

"No, you will stay back for Flurry's sake. 'sides, Crystal Ponies will go bonkers if they lose their Crystal Princess. You know that I am more of a figurehead anyway, and you're the real deal."

 He was right, she needed to admit. Instead, she clenched her teeth and looked directly in his eye.

"You are a fool."

"Yeah," he hummed, keeping gearing up.

"Why are you always making it all so complicated?"

"Yeah."

"You're completely not thinking about me. About us."

"M-hm."

Cadance made a long exasperated groan. She leaned forward, looked deeply into the Shining's eyes: "Why I married so heartless bastard? You're absolutely despicable."

"Because you love me." He pecked her cheek, passing along. She made a subtle step after him

"No, I hate you. Hate you. You hear?"

He smiled with that foolish smile, that fooly fool. He grabbed the sword, tested how it slides out of sheath, and turned away. 
"So, will it be the last words that you've ever said to your husband?"

"Yeah!" She smiled widely, tearing up. "Come back alive for better ones, you fool."

He chuckled, glanced at her mischievously over the shoulder, and simply nodded. Her heart thrumped. After all, she wanted some spice and drama.

Каданс ненавидит чейнджлингов
She's a diplomat, and there is but one method of diplomacy when dealing with monsters. 

Про то что делают чейнджлинги с захваченными (как думает Каданс)

"Queen of Equestria demands your surrender, ponykind. You will be looked upon well."

"Ah'm coming with," Applejack stepped forward resolutely. 

Cadance : "Guards, detain 

Rarity: But Princess, why?

Cadance sighed. "Long ago, Celestia told me that you might be the last hope for Equestria, if things go sour. I am not the one to squander that hope."

Dear Celestia, how Cadance hated changelings.
Disgusting creatures.

Pity and disgust, and fear

"How can such creatures even exist?"

No honor...


Her movements were fluid and graceful, yet also powerful and precise.

"Celestia did!?" She uttered in a small voice, barely a squeak.

13:42]Flovv Krovv: Каданс и Шайнинг сражаются спиной к спине, пока не остаются только они двое. Шайнинг перезаряжает арбалет, Каданс прикрывает их обоих магическим щитом. Чейнджлинги ударяются о него, пытаясь пробить.

She can't teleport and keep barrier at same time (описать как оценивает ситуацию)

"I won't give in to them alive again, Shining." 

"Neither will I." He answering grimly, his eyes constantly surveying the magic barrier for cracks.

"So... what should we do?" Cadance asked. Her gaze lingered on Shining's sword.

Shining looked back starkly. Then, he smiled. "What, are you going to give up, Cadance? That easily? Before breaking all teeth in Chryssie's smug grin?"

The Princess of Love smiled openly back, spark trembled in her eyes. "Never!"

"You won't leave Flurry alone, won't you?"

"Of course not!" she smirked fearlessly. His love. All that she needs is his love. Warm feeling was washing all over her... They will prevail!

Cadance turned away, watching how monsters began to try to break through the barrier even more eagerly.

"I think I have enough magic for a teleportation spell." Shining uttered grimly, still looking at her. His horn flared, charging energy. "But it will be wild. I'm out of practice with long distances."

"Whatever, just to get out of here is enough. They I'll fly us out."

"Great. Brace yourself. And give 'em hell."

Her ear twitched, and Cadance turned. Her eyes widened.
"Love?..."

Spell hit her immediately. She didn't react fast enough. Sensation of vertigo overwhelmed her, she realized the she is flailing as she is falling through the air. Something colorful appeared before her, and she instinctively raised forelegs, protecting head.
