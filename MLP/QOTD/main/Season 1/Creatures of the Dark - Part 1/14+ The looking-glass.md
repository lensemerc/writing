When she went through the looking-glass, one thing was certain: she was in the world of the creator, who lost faith in his own creation.
backwards + upside down



As she went through the churning, blinding kaleidoscope, her whole body distorted into a thin line, which was spiraling along the walls of a long, vibrant tunnel, while being outstretched, bent, and torn between dimensions. She just couldn't restrain a loud scream, breaking out of her. It wasn't painful at all, though. It was [i]ticklish[/i]! It was like if you're going through a huge magical rainbow-colored laundry machine, only in the end you do not get thoroughly washed, just spat head first into another world.

Absolutely mesmerising experience.

Each time there was an underlying feeling of dread that something would go wrong, which was then followed by a liberating understanding that everything was fine. Sunset flew out of the other end of the tunnel like a cannonball and slammed with her hindquarters into a wall, lying against it upside-down.

"Ouch," she whinnied, lying in the darkened room, and giggled: "Oh, [i]man[/i]. It hurts."

One would've thought they'd place a mattress for her already. Sunset scrambled up to her hooves and stood up on her hind legs, wobbling on the spot. She let out a tiny laugh, trying to make a step with these new limbs.

By stars, this was [i]weird[/i]. She absolutely loved this! Visiting Equestria was worth at least for the feel when your limbs transform into something completely different. And this was supposed to be her original body, right?... Sunset wasn't even so sure about that anymore, amd she had a suspicion that if she begin to mull over the inconsistency too hard, she would land some sort of psychosis for her troubles. 

So, nevermind that. She came here to have fun, after all.

When she was leaving Canterlot High, it was still noon, and yet there was barely any sunlight. With a thoughtful look, Sunset pressed her hooves into her hips, trying to determine if it was morning or evening out there. If it's the former, she just might be in time to visit that strange wedding; if it's the latter, well...

Come to think of it, she began to notice oddities in the room. Castle of Friendship was not at all like she remembered it. Also, isn't Princess Twilight moved the Crystal Mirror to Canterlot? 

"Guys? Anyone, uh, [i]anypony[/i]?" Sunset called, nervously smiling.

Something fishy was going on. She took another wobbly step, then landed back on all fours, and sighed in satisfaction. She stubbornly began to make her way across the room, still reeling from the effects of thaumic resonance. Her head rung and vision wavered, and while being unaccustomed to the body, she bumped with a flank into a huge tower of books, stockpiled right on the floor.

"[i]Why? Why are there so many books?[/i]" she internally whinnied in genuine equine horror, watching how that tower collapses onto another one, that one falls into third... Before long, Sunset stood in midst of complete chaos, looking around with a dumbfounded look.

Now there's just needed to be someone to bust in and caught her red-handed.

As if on cue, magic of teleportation flared, and before Sunset there was a familiar  with an ignited horn

"Who are you?" she pointed accusatory hoof at , ""

"H-hey, Glim, what's up with that?" Sunset spoke in upbeat tone, trying not to show any worry. Her snark slipped through, anyway: "Jumpy much?"

"Oh. You're Sunset, right? Sunset Shimmer?" the mare's voice softened, as she apprehended a situation. Her blinding hornlight died down as well,

"Oh, stars," Sunset giggled, looking at the ceiling, "Oh, [i]man[/i]. You would think you'd put some mattress for me already."

Starlight is always making excuses to keep from having to learn more friendship lessons, and has outright denied growing like when she didn't want to leave Twilight too early after the changeling's second invasion. Sunset is very similar, and is always trying to charge herself with the responsibility of helping out wherever she can. But when it comes time to ask for help, she wants to be able to do it on her own

"Thank you, Starlight." Twilight pulled herself back, giving the mare a warm smile. "I trust you completely."

"I don't think that she researched it"

"How she couldn't!?" Sunset sounded almost appaled at this prospect. Twilight [i]she[/i] knew would be all over such a phenomena.

"I don't know, okay?" Starlight's voice fell, and she rubbed her temple.

"What is it? Your head hurts?"

Starlight pensively nodded. 



"Oh, I am a repatriot, alright," Sunset giggled, "You haven't heard of me, right?"


"We came to celebrate"
"Alas, we all got duped"

Starlight's "This would be so much faster if I just killed everyone" face.


"How would you wield it?" 

"Well, with your hooves." Starlight replied tensely.

Sunset looked at her hoof, then back at the weapon. "It doesn't make sense."

Rapidly making a few blinks, Starlight cocked her head to the side, staring back at Sunset. "What doesn't make sense?" She asked warily.

Sunset thought to herself that Starlight must be very weirded out by it, but frankly, they were in the same boat for this one. She eyed her hoof intently, licked her lips, smacked them, and eventually offered in contemplative tone: "I don't seem to recall to be able to take anything with my hooves. Well, [i]mostly[/i]. They are usually not for taking stuff." Her voice was beginning to grow increasingly unsure. "Right?"

Starlight looked at her hoof too. She went with quiet 'Huh', turning it from side to side.

Both mares spent some time like that, just examining their respective forelegs.

Sunset spoke again: "I don't recall seeing any swords before, either."

"You're just pulling my leg now."

"No, I'm being serious!"



"Can't you just lock it up and go?"

"Well, I..." Starlight smiled nervously, "Twilight [i]did[/i] said to watch over it. Understand me correctly, "

"Come on, who will break in anyway? It's [i]Ponyville[/i]."

"Changelings?" Starlight offered, unsure.

"Seems like it's not in their priority. How [i]they[/i] would know that all this stuff is here, anyway?"

Starlight awkwardly shrugged, glanced at artifacts around them, and picked the floor with a hoof: "I've never seen them," she said in small voice, "I do not know what they can't and can do."

To be frank, Sunset never met changelings too‚Äîbut she heard quite a high tales about them. She tapped foreleg on her chin, thinking.

Starlight frowned: ""

[9:04]Forcalor: Would you say that she is prone to take charge in situations at least, and more of a type of proactive, not reactive, protagonist? 
[9:05]Forcalor: (though protagonists usually react anyway)

Maybe there is something stable at this day, or more specificaly at this time-frame

Besides, someone is already using unsanctioned temporal magic. Can't you see?

"The stars have shifted their pattern."

"What?" Starlight bleated, wide-eyed.

"The [i]stars[/i]," the old guy repeated with manic look, "have shifted their [i]pattern[/i]."

"How it c-can be possible?" Sunset found her voice, albeit unsatisfiyngly stuttering, "What does it even mean?"

"It is exactly what it sounds, and it can mean a multitude of things," Starswirl flicked his beard dismissively, and it could just as well indicate that he has no freakin' idea what to say, "We should be concerned with what it means for [i]us[/i]."

"No, wait, was our planet somehow misplaced in completely different position?" Sunset pressed hoof against her muzzle, trying to wrap her head around all this, then asked, hopeful: "We could've just changed rotation, or mirrored the skyline, or what if we somehow now having a completely different angle of view? Or, or..." Her voice fell under the looks of her peers, as she comprehended that last one won't factor in it at all. Then she recalled the Starswirl's planetarium from alternate Equestria, and lit up: "What about other planets in our solar system? Are they still in their place?"

Starlight stared at her blankly. Starswirl harrumphed: "Other planes of existence are still where they are belong, if that is what you're implying."

At this moment Sunset needed to sit down. She recalled comething.

"That pattern of the stars. You are able to read them, you're a court astrologer, at least of that I am certain. Do they offer you any insight into what's going on?" she asked.

The old wizard nodded, "That is the discussion I wanted to convene before your incessant interruptions, child," he frowned, "In the stars, I saw nothingness." 

"Of what kind?" Starlight pried.

"Of any kind. [i]Nothngness.[/i]" He repeated forcefully, "They do not have constellations anymore, and I do not mean that I cannot recognize any of them. They lack of any kind of order. They became alien, completely unknown to me."

The implications were there, but it still was hard to grasp. "So, what does it means to us?" Sunset relented.

"Glad you began asking the right questions," Starswirl said with bile in his voice, and then grimaced, "It means that we cannot project the current of events that will transpire. To this day, they were premeditated until the certain spot."

"I don't suppose it is something that we were able to do in the first place," Starlight noticed apprehensively, "Isn't the future is fluid, always in motion? I mean, you can return in the past and change the things that are happening in our present, are you not?"

Starswirl frowned, "Please elaborate, what led you to this concept?"

"While I was using your spells, Master Starswirl, I almost destroyed the whole world. I saw how reality around me was changing, and it all was based on a single event, when the Bearers of the Elements were getting their cutie marks. If Twilight hadn't stopped me back then and hadn't shown me the Magic of Friendship, everything around us could eventually became a barren wasteland with no signs of life."

"Child, you saw only what you needed to see," Starswirl looked like he bit on a lemon. Sunset realized that he hoped to weasel out from having this conversation in the first place, and glanced disparagingly. This sly old raccoon... "It isn't how the time travel works. It doesn't signify that events that transpired were any less [i]real[/i] for you and Twilight, but I can assure you, they weren't breaking the reality in the way that you percieved."

"So what, was I [i]meant[/i] to lose to Twilight and her special friends?" in Starlight's voice there was tension, "And all that happened before, with me and the village, is it just part of a plan too? Did it even mattered what I've felt back then, and what I went through?"

Sunset decided that she needs to step in. She placed a hoof on Starlight's shoulder, and saw hurt in her eyes. "Look, I do not know much about all this stuff, but it [i]did[/i] led you in a better place than you was before, right?"

"I guess so," she replied in a small voice, and sniffed wetly.

"Back where I came from, you've become the princip‚Äîthe [i]headmare[/i] of the Friendship School," Sunset said proudly, "You with Sunburst as your vice-headmare made a great team, helping a lot of students to find their way."

"Friendship School?" Starlight smiled, "I think Twilight would've absolutely loved it. And me and Sunburst, we were this close, working on something together? That seems unbelivable..."

Starswirl scoffed, stroking his beard, "A School for Friendship lessons. Isn't that peculiar. Seems like a complete waste of resources." 

"Uh, if I'm not mistaken, you were enrolled in it too," Sunset retorted, "Twilight was talking about how [i]even you[/i] were making strides in understanding Friendship. I'm sure "

"Sunset," Starlight suddenly asked, "what if things that you've experienced were some sort of magic construct too?"

"What?" Sunset blinked, taken aback by suggestion.

"You seem to be from some alternate future, am I correct? I've seen something similar in my own time, and [i]he[/i]," Starlight nodded at old mage, "just said that this thing can be fabricated."

"I didn't said [i]that[/i]!" the old mage fervently defended himself, "And what's going on with [i]her[/i] is a completely different precedent. She isn't supposed to [i]be[/i] here! It's all that wedding and its distortion, it's that fulcrum event, that forced the whole paradigm to be changed!"

"A what now?" Sunset raised her ear curiously, "You mean everything changed, like with the pattern of the stars?"


First Compendium of Equestrian Laws



"Where is it?" he looked at them accusatory, his gruff voice sounded demandingly, "I've left it right there, right before I went to pick you up. Is it some clandestine ploy of yours? Did someone of you stole it?"

"Um, not me," Starlight replied sheepishly, and looked at Sunset. She shook her head violently.

"What is going on in here!?" Starswirl bellowed and took a step, looking around, "Is this some joke? A [i]changeling[/i] magic?" He looked at his subordinates, "Is someone here working for the Queen?"

His horn flared with hot white aura, which quickly enveloped the room. Sunset recognized a complex revealing spell, intended to strip away illusions in a wide area.

As scared mares began to gawk at him and each other, and utter words of denial, Starswirl recognized the futility of his actions and raised his foreleg: "Enough," and rubbed his forehead with it. "I think I know what it tied to, and perpetrator must be already long gone," he said grimly, "Time is of an essence, as always... Why I [i]must[/i] do everything by myself?..."

Starlight offered in a tense voice: "Master Starswirl, if you require any help from us, you should tell what's on your mind."

"No," he replied combatively, "More likely something had scrambled your memories, than something like [i]that[/i] occured."

"Evil creepy."

Starlight examined the statue. "He seems jovial. Like he is singing."

"What, Elements of Harmony hit him in the shower, or something?" Sunset rubbed her chin, pondering.

Starlight seemed to become stupefied from the mental image.

Sunset elaborated: "I mean, how [i]do[/i] you think Sisters got a drop on the guy? He is supposed to be omnipotent. You think he just sat around and [i]let[/i] it happen?"
