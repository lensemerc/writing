When she went through the looking-glass, one thing was certain: she was in the world of the creator, who lost faith in his own creation.
backwards + upside down



As she went through the churning, blinding kaleidoscope, her whole body distorted into a thin line, which was spiraling along the walls of a long, vibrant tunnel, literally outstretched, torn, and bent between dimensions. She just couldn't restrain a loud scream, which broke out of her. It wasn't painful at all, though. It was [i]ticklish[/i], even fun! I was like if you're going through a huge magical rainbow-colored laundry machine, only in the end you do not get thoroughly washed but spat head first into another world.

Seriously, how did [i]that[/i] work?

Each time there was an underlying feeling of dread that something would go wrong, which was then followed by a liberating understanding that everything was fine. Sunset flew out of the other end of the tunnel like a cannon and slammed with her hindquarters into a wall, lying against it upside-down.

"Ouch," she whinnied, looking at the darkened room, and giggled, "Oh, [i]man[/i]. It hurts."

One would've thought they'd gotten some mattresses for her already. Sunset scrambled up to her hooves and stood up on her hind legs, wobbling around. She let out a nervous laugh, trying to make a step with these new limbs.

By stars, this is [i]weird[/i]! She absolutely loved this. Visiting Equestria was worth at least to experience this strange feeling when your feet merge into something completely different. And come to think of it, this was supposed to be her original body, right? Sunset was pretty sure that if she began to mull over the thought seriously, she would land some sort of psychosis for her troubles, so she needed to drop this line of thinking immediately.

She came here for fun, after all.

When she was leaving Canterlot High, it was still noon, and yet there was barely any sunlight. Sunset pressed her hooves into her hips, trying to determine if it was morning or evening out here. If it's the former, she just might be in time to visit that strange wedding; if it's the latter, well...

Curious. Castle of Friendship was looking weird, not like she remembered. And she was certain that Princess Twilight moved the Crystal Mirror to Canterlot.

"Girls? Anyone, uh, [i]anypony[/i]?" Sunset called, looking around.

Something fishy was going on. She took another wobbly step, then landed back on all fours, and sighed in satisfaction.




Feelings of dread, 


"Oh, stars," Sunset giggled, looking at the ceiling, "Oh, [i]man[/i]. You would think you'd put some mattress for me already."

Starlight is always making excuses to keep from having to learn more friendship lessons, and has outright denied growing like when she didn't want to leave Twilight too early after the changeling's second invasion. Sunset is very similar, and is always trying to charge herself with the responsibility of helping out wherever she can. But when it comes time to ask for help, she wants to be able to do it on her own

"Thank you, Starlight." Twilight pulled herself back, giving the mare a warm smile. "I trust you completely."

Edge of peace

I am edge of peace. Devoted one, draw me against the enemy of life.

"I don't think that she researched it"

"How she couldn't!?" Sunset sounded almost appaled at this prospect. Twilight [i]she[/i] knew would be all over such a phenomena.

"I don't know, okay?" Starlight's voice fell, and she rubbed her temple.

"What is it? Your head hurts?"

Starlight pensively nodded. 



"Oh, I am a repatriot, alright," Sunset giggled, "You haven't heard of me, right?"


"We came to celebrate"
"Alas, we all got duped"

Starlight's "This would be so much faster if I just killed everyone" face.


"How would you wield it?" 

"Well, with your hooves." Starlight replied tensely.

Sunset looked at her hoof, then back at the weapon. "It doesn't make sense."

Rapidly making a few blinks, Starlight cocked her head to the side, staring back at Sunset. "What doesn't make sense?" She asked warily.

Sunset thought to herself that Starlight must be very weirded out by it, but frankly, they were in the same boat for this one. She eyed her hoof intently, licked her lips, smacked them, and eventually offered in contemplative tone: "I don't seem to recall to be able to take anything with my hooves. Well, [i]mostly[/i]. They are usually not for taking stuff." Her voice was beginning to grow increasingly unsure. "Right?"

Starlight looked at her hoof too. She went with quiet 'Huh', turning it from side to side.

Both mares spent some time like that, just examining their respective forelegs.

Sunset spoke again: "I don't recall seeing any swords before, either."

"You're just pulling my leg now."

"No, I'm being serious!"



"Can't you just lock it up and go?"

"Well, I..." Starlight smiled nervously, "Twilight [i]did[/i] said to watch over it. Understand me correctly, "

"Come on, who will break in anyway? It's [i]Ponyville[/i]."

"Changelings?" Starlight offered, unsure.

"Seems like it's not in their priority. How [i]they[/i] would know that all this stuff is here, anyway?"

Starlight awkwardly shrugged, glanced at artifacts around them, and picked the floor with a hoof: "I've never seen them," she said in small voice, "I do not know what they can't and can do."

To be frank, Sunset never met changelings too‚Äîbut she heard quite a high tales about them. She tapped foreleg on her chin, thinking.

Starlight frowned: ""

[9:05]Forcalor: (though protagonists usually react anyway)

"Evil creepy."

Starlight examined the statue. "He seems jovial. Like he is singing."

"What, Elements of Harmony hit him in the shower, or something?" Sunset rubbed her chin, pondering.

Starlight seemed to become stupefied from the mental image.

Sunset elaborated: "I mean, how [i]do[/i] you think Sisters got a drop on the guy? He is supposed to be omnipotent. You think he just sat around and [i]let[/i] it happen?"

Black hand grabbed her mid-sentence and whisked into the statue.

Starlight trembled and took a step back, before involuntarily unleashing her magic. A radiant ray lunched forward, demolishing the statue, as well as making long burning gap in the ground.

That black hand was [i]not normal[/i].
