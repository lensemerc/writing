When she went through the looking-glass, one thing was certain: she was in the world of the creator, who lost faith in his own creation.
backwards + upside down



As she went through the churning, blinding kaleidoscope, her whole body distorted into a thin line, which was spiraling along the walls of a vibrant tunnel while being outstretched, bent, and torn in most of all possible dimensions. She just couldn't restrain a loud scream, breaking out of her. It wasn't painful at all, though. It was [i]ticklish[/i]! It was like going through a huge magical rainbow-colored laundry machine, but in the end you do not get thoroughly washed; you just spat headfirst into another world.

Absolutely mesmerizing experience. Oddly nostalgic too, especially when she would remember the first time when it happened to her. Despite all the years that passed, it was still so easy to recall that night in vivid detail... And ever since, each time there was an underlying feeling of dread, an expectation that something would go wrong, which was then followed by a liberating assurance that everything was fine. 

It was supposed to be fine now, too. After what felt like a small eternity, Sunset flew out of the other end of the tunnel like a cannonball and slammed with her hindquarters into a wall, lying against it upside-down.

"Ouch," she sighed, observing the darkened room, and giggled: "Oh, [i]man[/i]." It hurts so much."

One would've thought they'd place a mattress for her already. Sunset scrambled up to her hooves and stood up on her hind legs, wobbling on the spot. She let out a tiny laugh, trying to make a step with these new limbs.

By stars, this was [i]weird[/i]. She absolutely loved this! Visiting Equestria was worth at least for the feeling when your limbs transform into something completely different. And this was supposed to be her original body, right?... Sunset wasn't even so sure about that anymore, and she had a suspicion that if she began to mull over the inconsistency too hard, she would land some sort of psychosis for her trouble.

So, nevermind that. She came here to have fun, after all.

When she was leaving Canterlot High, it still was noon, and yet here was barely any sunlight now. It was concerning, as usually the time between their worlds was more consistent. With a thoughtful look, Sunset pressed her hooves into her hips, trying to determine if it was morning or evening outside. If it's the former, she just might be in time to visit that strange wedding; if it's the latter, well...

As she stood like that, she began to notice other oddities. The Castle of Friendship was not at all like she remembered it. Also, hasn't Princess Twilight moved the Crystal Mirror to Canterlot?

"Guys? Anyone, uh, [i]anypony[/i]?" Sunset called, nervously smiling.

Something fishy was going on. She took another wobbly step, then landed back on all fours and sighed in satisfaction. She stubbornly began to make her way across the room, still reeling from the strong effects of thaumic resonance. Her ears rang and her vision wavered, and while being unaccustomed to the body, she bumped with a flank into a huge tower of books, stockpiled right on the floor.

"[i]Why? Why are there so many books?[/i]" she internally whinnied in genuine equine terror, watching how that tower collapses onto another one, that one falls into third... Before long, Sunset stood in the midst of complete chaos, looking around with a dumbfounded look.

Now there needs to be someone to bust in and catch her red-handed.

As if on cue, a spark of teleportation flared, and before Sunset, there was a familiar purple-ish figure with an ignited horn, blinding with its intensity. Sunset squinted her eyes, smiling. Twilight? Ah, no, not her...

"Who are you?" Starlight pointed an accusatory hoof at Sunset, dishing out a barrage of questions: "How did you come here? What are you doing here?!"

"Hey-y, Glim, what's up?" Sunset tensed up, but spoke in upbeat tone, trying not to show any worry. Her snark slipped through anyway: "Jumpy much? It's me, Sunset! Sorry about the mess."

"Sunset Shimmer? From the other universe?" The mare's voice softened as she surveyed the situation. Her blinding hornlight died down as well. "Uh... I am pleased to finally meet you, I guess." In a total whiplash, she smiled sheepishly, "Wish the circumstances were better... My name is Starlight Glimmer."

Sunset looked at her dumbfoundedly, then rubbed her temple, frowning. "Okay," she uttered, "I didn't expect that."

Starlight seemed pale and disheveled, like she hadn't slept or eaten well. There was desperation in her unfamiliar small voice—things weren't looking good. "I was asked by Twilight to wait for your arrival," she explained, "Then we were supposed to go to the royal wedding."

"She did write me as such," Sunset had left behind the journal she used to communicate with Twilight and already came to regret it. "Starlight, are you sure it is the first time we've met each other?"

Starlight tilted her head curiously and pensively nodded.

[i]Is this Memory Stone's doing? Were her memories erased?[/i] No, somehow it didn't seemed that way. It was hard to internalize, but even the air was different now. The festive mood completely left Sunset at this point, and she sat down with a sigh. Never a dull moment, huh? "What about the weird wedding? Is that still on the table?" she murmured, trying to find some semblance of normality. "I hope you don't mind that I said it out loud: a wedding between Princesses [i]is[/i] freakin' weird."

Starlight grimaced in response and traced her eyes aside. "I'm not sure about anything," she mumbled. "There's a persistent rumor that changelings struck at Canterlot during festivities, when they were least expected. Guess it's true."

"What, seriously!?" Sunset stood back up.

"The combat was going on for most of the night," Starlight nodded, "There was an intense light too; I think the whole Equestria saw that. It rumbled like it's going to be an earthquake." Her ears splayed back, "I'm not sure that Equestria even ever had earthquakes... Mostly everyone in Ponyville are staying at their homes now, waiting until we have concrete news about what's going on. Some families had fled. Can't blame them."

"Huh." Sunset mustered. Her mind went blank for a moment as she tried to comprehend all that. "Aren't the changelings on the ponies' side?" She asked uncertainly, "I thought you and Twilight had brokered a truce with their species?"

"Are you sure about that? I've never met them, I [i]think[/i]," Starlight replied, "Hope you aren't one of them, cause' it will just make it all more awkward."

Sunset stared for a moment, then cleared her throat. At least in this regard, they were on the same page—she never saw even a single changeling either. "Why did you remain here?" Sunset arched a brow. "All the girls, and who knows who else, are out there, right? They all might've needed your help!"

Starlight gave her a pitiful look, and Sunset felt slightly embarrassed about own accusatory tone. "I wanted to," Starlight mumbled, "but you could come through at any minute. Besides, Twilight [i]is[/i] usually good at handling these types of emergencies."

"That she is," Sunset begrudgingly acknowledged. It didn't settled with her right.

"There is also something important I need to keep an eye on. Sunset, you're a good friend of Twilight, right? Can I confide with you?"

"I owe everything to Princess Twilight," Sunset replied in an unwavering voice.

Starlight smiled, warming up: "Come. Let me show you something."

They went on through the tall passages of the Castle of Friendship, devoid of most light except for the dim sunlight streaming from the elaborate crystal windows. Without Twilight or any ponies, or other creatures for that matter, the whole place gave an abandoned and alien impression. Sunset remembered how cozy it was before. All the purple and lavender colors around were dull now, suppressed to an almost indescernable gray.

And that's why, when Starlight walked over to one of the doors, looking just like the rest, and opened it with a push of a hoof, Sunset couldn't contain her amazement.

"Woah," she whispered, "Is this real?"

The small room was filled with various artifacts, mostly unknown to Sunset but invoking images from ancient books and legends. A hidden treasure trove...

"Since when Princess Twilight became a collector?" She asked in complete awe, walking around all the magical splendor, "Is that the Helm of Shadows? The old Horn of the Everfree? Here's that alicorn amulet... Oh, the Talisman of Mirage? And there, are those all eight legendary artifacts of Mage Meadowbrook?"

"All eight indeed," Starlight shrugged, as if it was nothing special. 

"How did all this stuff ended up in here?"

"How?" Starlight replied in strange, strained voice. She hung head, furrowing brows, "That is a rather... odd question, don't you think?"

"What do you mean?" Sunset flicked her ear, stepping in front of the postament in middle of the room—the centerpiece of the whole gallery. She traced her gaze upwards to [i]what[/i] was on display, and shook her head, not believing own eyes. "And what's [i]this[/i]?"

"Ah." Starlight came to her side, eyeing the treasure, hovering in midair, "It is just the sword, made from shards of the Elements of Harmony. That's what I wanted to show to you."

Sunset sat down, her eyes rounded up. The Sword looked more like a [i]tree branch[/i] than a blade. Crooked and obscenely massive, shimmering with inner light, and covered with glistening embossed arcane symbols and engravings, the beautiful thing had no right to exist. "This is ridiculous," Sunset said, puzzled.

"What? Why?"

"Well, for starters, how would you wield it?" 

"Uh, with your hooves?" Starlight replied tensely, like it was something obvious.

Sunset looked at her hoof, then back at the weapon. "It doesn't make sense."

Rapidly making a few blinks, Starlight tilted her head hard to the side, staring at Sunset. "What doesn't make sense?" she asked warily.

Sunset thought to herself that Starlight must be very weirded out by it, but frankly, they were in the same boat for this one. She eyed her hoof intently, licked her lips, smacked them, and eventually offered in contemplative tone: "I don't seem to recall to be able to take anything with my hooves before. Well, [i]mostly[/i]. They are usually not for taking stuff." Her voice was beginning to grow increasingly unsure. "Right?"

Starlight looked at her hoof too. She went with quiet 'Huh', turning it from side to side.

Both mares spent some time like that, just examining their respective forelegs.

Sunset spoke again: "I don't recall seeing any swords before, either."

"You're just pulling my leg now."

"No, I'm being serious!"

"Are you sure you're from Equestria? Maybe that other universe messed you up somehow."

"No, it is not me who is wrong!" Sunset fiercely blurted out, before she managed to stop herself, "It is everything else!"

Starlight gave her an incredulous look, creasing a brow.

Sunset giggled, feeling how tips of her ears started to burn: "It's true, though! It's so odd... I feel as if I am in a dream, or being fooled."

"Well..." Starlight rubbed her chin, trying to imagine a compelling counterargument and failing, "I feel the same way, can tell you that much... I wanted for you to take a look at the inscription on the blade. Can you tell anything about it?"

"Give me a minute." Sunset pressed her forelegs on the edge of postament and stretched out, moving muzzle closer to the weapon, "Who forged it, anyway?"

"I'm not sure. It just appeared, I think," Starlight sounded flabbergasted, as if idea of questioning the origins of the artifact was novel to her.

Sunset glanced at her suspiciously, and then examined the darkened steel of the weapon thoroughly. "[i]What a stupid thing.[/i]" The engravings were easy to discern, but the design didn't bear any fancy pattern. Instead there were just words, running along the surface. "'Ego sum ferrum pacis. Devoto, trahe me contra hostem vitae,''" She slowly read aloud, "And there's something else..." She blinked, and rubbed her eyes.

"What do you see?" She heard Starlight's voice.

"It is as if the words are slowly shifting," Sunset tried to explain, "Was it like that before?"

"Yes, it does it constantly. I think Twilight wrote down some of the phrases, but I couldn't find where," Starlight frowned, "Can you translate?"

Sunset mulled it over. "It is an ancient pony language, same one in which Princessess Celestia and Luna are named. Don't believe it was in curriculum, though," Sunset made a face, "and it's not like Princess Celestia was eager to share her secrets when I studied under her," her voice became sorrowful, as she reminisced about all that happened.

"You were Celestia's student?" Starlight's voice was full of appropriate reveree.

Sunset snorted, entertained by a thought that they are having this conversation again: "I was [i]the[/i] Celestia's student. Best of the best. Sadly, I was overeager to achieve results, and it didn't go well with her. We had a falling out. I think it was for the better, honestly... I was much more narrowminded back then... Now I'm not just her former student, I'm a pony on my own, and I have my own path to walk."

"Sometimes we need to hit rock bottom before we begin to truly climb up. I know the feel."

"Anyway..." Sunset sighed, and then all of a sudden made a startingly pleasant revelation: she noticed that she has a horn on the forehead. Immediately, she streamed her will through this fifth limb, trying to get a grip on the sword with manifested aura. 

The pain of backlash ran through her with an intensity of flashing electricity surge, directly into her skull and then down the backbone. Sunset gasped, ceased all attempt at magic, and jerked back: "What was that!?"

"Sorry, I should've warned you!" Starlight turned to her, worriying, "This thing doesn't wants to be touched."

"I've figured," Sunset winced, holding onto the tingling horn, "You mean to say it has a will of it's own?" 

"Well, it [i]is[/i] made from the Elements of Harmony," Starlight looked at her pathetically, "Who's to say? The girls couldn't lift it too, so it's just hanging there..."

"I see... Did you try to communicate with it?"

"What, to talk with it? No?... I don't think that Twilight even researched into it..."

"How she couldn't!?" Sunset sounded almost appaled at this prospect. Twilight [i]she[/i] knew would be all over such a phenomena.

"I don't know, okay? All I know that she wanted others to be quiet about it, because it seems too dangerous and unusual..." Starlight's voice fell, and she rubbed her temple. 

"What is it? Your head hurts?"

Starlight pensively nodded. Something [i]did[/i] affect the memories of the mare, that was certain. Sunset needed to find other girls and discover what condition [i]they[/i] are in... Maybe she can even reach out to Princess Celestia?...

When she thought about her old mentor, her heart responded with dull pain. In truth, they never really reconciled. They never talked about exactly what happened or how they felt. There was no moment of [i]connection[/i]. It might've sounded selfish, but Sunset still dreaded meeting the ancient alicorn Princess. She seemed so happy without her, and she was always so busy to boot, engrossed with her rulership, surrounded by her friends and returned sister. Their once strong bond had faded, leaving Sunset on her own, and the absence of warmth made her question if their relationship had ever truly mattered.

But it was how things were supposed to be, she figured. It means growing up. Sunset had her own life now and her own place in the world, and she was never in a hurry to return to Equestria anyway. It is okay to feel all these things and maybe even be slightly [i]jealous[/i]...

She clenched her teeth. The first thing to do is to make a grand survey of the situation anyway, so she would need to check up on other girls before going into the thick of it. Sunset hoped that all Twilight's friends are unharmed.

She traced her eyes aside, trying to decide if the artifacts could aid her in the journey. It was obvious why they were gathered in one place: the potential danger could be enormous, and right now this danger can be contained.

"I will be going to Canterlot," she said determined, "You're coming with, Starlight. Come on, lock it up and let's go."

"Well, um..." Starlight smiled nervously, "What if someone breaks in?"

"Who will even [i]do[/i] that? It's [i]Ponyville[/i]."

"Changelings?" Starlight offered, unsure.

"I doubt it's their priority. How [i]they[/i] would know that all this stuff is in here, anyway?" She pondered aloud, as her gaze fell on something familiar between all the oddities and trinkets around, "Hey, what's this?" 

Her horn lit up, levitating a simple leather-bound book, with Celestia's cutie mark emblazoned on the cover.

"This old thing... It was used by the Princess to communicate with me way back when, and recently by Twilight..." Sunset sighed nostalgically, opened it up and flipped through pages quickly, curious to see any changes.

Her brows furrowed hard, and her mouth pressed into a thin line. As she looked through the book, her expression became more and more concerned, until she eventually turned to Starlight, who was observing it with bated breath.

Sunset wordlessly showed the contents of the book. In an unfamiliar hornwriting, pages upon pages, one singular phrase was repeated endlessly, filling all possible space:

[center]"See you soon."[/center]

[center]═════════════════════════════ 𒀭𒀭𒀭 ═════════════════════════════[/center]

𒄈 [b][size=1.1em]A[/size][/b]fter the incident with the creepy book, Sunset didn't need to work hard to persuade Starlight to leave the dark and lonely Castle of Friendship.

Honestly, it was pleasing to see such a levelheaded mare. She was taking the action right where it counted, and she quickly began to remind Starlight of Twilight. Starlight wished for this power too, to be free of doubts and appear confident and leading.

If only it could ease the burden of harboring dark impulses in her heart...

With their teleportation skills, they were before the city's outer wall only in dozen of minutes or so. Both mares found themselves right before the comparably small crowd, slowly leaving the gates. Starlight craned neck, trying to get a glimpse of any familiar ponies, but all she had seen is tired and scared expressions of citizens. 

Starlight still harbored some resentment for the capital of Equestria, this stuck-up city, full of stuck-up ponies born with a silver spoon in their mouths, but she didn't wished for anyone to be actually [i]hurt[/i]. Not anymore, at least. Under the convoy of few members of the guard, ponies were heading toward the colorful train waiting at the station. Watching this procession, she bit inside of her cheek in the contemplation, turned to Sunset, and suddenly asked: "What do you think of the changelings' magic?"

"Huh?" Sunset, deep in thought and far more invested into plight of the citizens, reacted with pause: "What about it?"

"You think it is something that can be learned?" Starlight kept asking, curious. She quickly catched on that this friend of Twilight can possess some unique insight in the matter. 

Sunset humphed, "Now that's interesting. You mean the actual shapechanging part?"

"Their magic can include something more than that?"

"Of course. I believe that they can manipulate minds or emotions of others at their will. Or at least, their Hive Queen can."

"Oh." Starlight said in a small voice. Now that was something interesting. She turned to Sunset, completely forgetting about anything else that was going on: "Why would they have such set of abilities?"

"Hm-m?" Sunset blinked, "They just [i]do[/i]? It is their inherent trait, just like the magical aptitude of ponies. You don't see it being discussed at length, right?"

Starlight suddenly felt liberated while talking to this mare. She didn't gave any side-eye to her, she didn't [i]judged[/i] her. There never was this constant suspicion that Starlight, while trying to reform, wants the knowledge for some ill-fitting end. Her ears perked up: "Listen, it might sound overly ambitious, but can I hypothesize that spells dispelling charms and enchantments reveal their true forms while they are changed?"

"I think I can recall that happening," Sunset nodded pensively, but now somewhat engaged, "Why do you ask?"

"Well, the whole concept of completely changing your appearance and physical attributes is [i]preposterous[/i]," Starlight scoffed, "There's always some trickery involved when something like that happens. So what if it's just that? An elaborate illusion directed at the senses of everyone around?"

Sunset blinked, staring. Then she slowly arched a brow: "A perception trick?..."

"Exactly, Sunset. Do you think the changelings actually [i]change[/i] their bodies? Or do they just [i]illude[/i] it to the eyes of everypony else?... If it's some sort of elaborate illusion, then it would make sense that there is no set [i]real[/i] appearance of a changeling. But that begs the question that if that's the case, why do they require love to feed off of? Are they even real creatures themselves? Is it all just some... scheme?"

"I get what you're saying," Sunset slowly returned, "But I can guarantee you that changelings do, factually, exist. While I do not see obvious connotation between their abilities, you can probably find a changeling and ask all these questions to them by yourself."

"Ah, but that raises another question!" Starlight lifted a hoof, smiling, "Why do you think that [i]they[/i] know how their magic works? We still have not much insight into the nature of our own abilities, other than that they can be tied to emotions and require extensive practice, and what could be said about some weird backwater bugs?"

"Starlight, I will be frank: you are losing me on this one. We have much more pressing matters to be concerned with."

Starlight sighed. After all, speaking to Twilight would be much more fun in this regard, when she wasn't busy with her... friendship problems, and friendship lessons. "Guess you're right..." 

As she kept remembering how 


"Где ваш капитан?"

"She downed five cups of coffee."

"This is how I cope!" Pinkie Pie cheerfully replied, "I am afraid of what will happen if I stop! I guess it is very concerning, huh!?"


"I owe everything to Princess Twilight Sparkle," Sunset admitted in a small voice, looking lost and absentminded, "" (посмотреть, )

"I-I... I need their free will... Because... When they do as I ask... I feel... ***Special***." *She whispers. Her tail wags with joy, as she lets out a low moan with each tug he gives.*

*A slight, muffled moan leaves the mare's mouth, as Dusk rubs against her. She seems to enjoy that, but she continues laying there, with her face pressed against the floor.*

"The free-will of others... Can create unnecessary problems. The lack of cooperation, with the free-will of others... Can bring disaster. With free-will, you are given the freedom to leave. Leave from our town, our community... And once that happens, the whole purpose of our community... Is lost."

"Can't you just lock it up and go?"

"Well, I..." Starlight smiled nervously, "What if someone steals it?"

"Come on, who will break in anyway? It's [i]Ponyville[/i]."

"Changelings?" Starlight offered, unsure.

"Seems like it's not in their priority. How [i]they[/i] would know that all this stuff is here, anyway?"

Starlight awkwardly shrugged, and picked the floor with a hoof:

Edge of peace







I've always put Twilight, Starlight, and Sunset on the same power level - but the difference is in perspectives and how they utilize that power. Twilight spent her entire life holding back. She's been taught restraint, there's points where she actively fears her power, and she loses control when confronted with _truly_ high power levels until fairly late in the series. 
Starlight is self-taught and has never faced another pony who's even _vaguely_ on her level until she meets Twilight. She's a sledgehammer and that works fine for her. Raw blunt magical force has always worked for her, and she leans into it. (This is why she's able to match Twilight: she's going full force while Twilight is holding back.) 
Sunset, for a third perspective, has power but leans more into trickery and guile. Where Starlight never faced and equal, Sunset _always_ saw herself as weak because her every action was compared to Celestia. So she was never strong enough so instead she's all about novel approaches, edge cases, and elaborate plans. (Right up until she gets the Element, which she deems 'enough' and goes whole hog.)

1. ### 17:43_]_FanOfMostEverything_:_ 
    
    Twilight is blue. Magic is means by which she expands her knowledge and refines her craft, a tool she can employ (and can sometimes rely too much on) in pursuit of self-improvement, whether she defines that by being the best living spellbook imaginable or a good friend.
    
2. ### _[_17:45_]_FanOfMostEverything_:_ 
    
    Starlight is red. She is impulsive, she explicitly draws power from her emotions, and she _deeply_ resents being told what to do something she doesn't feel is right. She throws everything she has into what she does just because that's who she is. Middle gears are for ponies willing to compromise. Starlight needs an apocalypse rubbed in her muzzle before she can even consider she has the wrong idea.
    
3. ### _[_17:47_]_FanOfMostEverything_:_ 
    
    Sunset is the middle ground between them, the shared ally bridging the gap. In other words, she's black. Where Twilight uses magic for self-improvement, Sunset uses it for self _advancement_, furthering concrete ambitions (even when they're positive intentions) rather than an abstract, indeterminate goal of "getting better." She's not afraid to go all in, but it's for a purpose rather than simply because she refuses any other option.

Feelings of dread, 

Starlight is always making excuses to keep from having to learn more friendship lessons, and has outright denied growing like when she didn't want to leave Twilight too early after the changeling's second invasion. Sunset is very similar, and is always trying to charge herself with the responsibility of helping out wherever she can. But when it comes time to ask for help, she wants to be able to do it on her own

[9:04]Forcalor: Would you say that she is prone to take charge in situations at least, and more of a type of proactive, not reactive, protagonist? 
[9:05]Forcalor: (though protagonists usually react anyway) 
[9:09]EileenSaysHi: To an extent, but part of her growth is learning that she’s not always the most important person in the room, and that being a cheerleader for her friends has a worth of its own.
[9:10]EileenSaysHi: I’ve enjoyed the way EqG takes a more egalitarian approach to who plays leader in any given special, as opposed to FiM becoming the Twilight show anytime the bad guy is sufficiently big. 
[9:11]Forcalor: oh, now that's a good commentary to consider 
[9:12]Forcalor: yeah, just great 
[9:12]Forcalor: thanks

Красивые цветы обрамляют спящую Луну


Старсвирл прибывает позже. Он хочет забрать Старлайт, Сансет увязывается с ними.

Сцена с мелом

ПОВ: САНСЕТ
**Sunset Shimmer**: Princess Celestia has a sense of humor? Looks like I'm not the only one who's changed.

Про её чувства по поводу Целестии

Старсвирл не может вернуться назад во времени из-за фулкрум поинта



Maybe there is something stable at this day, or more specificaly at this time-frame

Besides, someone is already using unsanctioned temporal magic. Can't you see?

"The stars have shifted their pattern."

"What?" Starlight bleated, wide-eyed.

"The [i]stars[/i]," the old guy repeated with manic look, "have shifted their [i]pattern[/i]."

"How it c-can be possible?" Sunset found her voice, albeit unsatisfiyngly stuttering, "What does it even mean?"

"It is exactly what it sounds, and it can mean a multitude of things," Starswirl flicked his beard dismissively, and it could just as well indicate that he has no freakin' idea what to say, "We should be concerned with what it means for [i]us[/i]."

"No, wait, was our planet somehow misplaced in completely different position?" Sunset pressed hoof against her muzzle, trying to wrap her head around all this, then asked, hopeful: "We could've just changed rotation, or mirrored the skyline, or what if we somehow now having a completely different angle of view? Or, or..." Her voice fell under the looks of her peers, as she comprehended that last one won't factor in it at all. Then she recalled the Starswirl's planetarium from alternate Equestria, and lit up: "What about other planets in our solar system? Are they still in their place?"

Starlight stared at her blankly. Starswirl harrumphed: "Other planes of existence are still where they are belong, if that is what you're implying."

At this moment Sunset needed to sit down. She recalled comething.

"That pattern of the stars. You are able to read them, you're a court astrologer, at least of that I am certain. Do they offer you any insight into what's going on?" she asked.

The old wizard nodded, "That is the discussion I wanted to convene before your incessant interruptions, child," he frowned, "In the stars, I saw nothingness." 

"Of what kind?" Starlight pried.

"Of any kind. [i]Nothingness.[/i]" He repeated forcefully, "They do not have constellations anymore, and I do not mean that I cannot recognize any of them. They lack of any kind of order. They became alien, completely unknown to me."

The implications were there, but it still was hard to grasp. "So, what does it means to us?" Sunset relented.

"Glad you began asking the right questions," Starswirl answered with bile in his voice, stroking his beard, "It means that we cannot project the current of events that will transpire. To this day, they were... sparingly premeditated until the certain moment."

Starlight had a strange look on her face. "I didn't suppose we were able to do it in the first place," she said slowly, apprehensively, "Isn't the future always in motion? I mean, you can return in the past and change the things that are happening in our present, are you not?"

Starswirl frowned, "Elaborate. What led you to this conclusion?"

"While I was using your spells, Master Starswirl, I almost destroyed the whole world. I saw how reality around me was changing, and it all was based on a event when the Bearers of the Elements were getting their cutie marks. If Twilight hadn't stopped me back then and hadn't shown me the Magic of Friendship, everything around us could eventually became a barren wasteland with no signs of life."

"Child, you saw only what you needed to see," Starswirl looked like he bit on a lemon. Sunset realized that he hoped to weasel out from having this conversation in the first place, and glanced disparagingly. This sly old raccoon... "It isn't how the time travel works. It doesn't signify that events that transpired were any less [i]real[/i] for you and Twilight, but I can assure you, they weren't breaking the reality in the way that you percieved."

"So what, was I [i]meant[/i] to lose to Twilight and her special friends?" in Starlight's voice there was tension, "And all that happened before, with me and the village, is it just part of a plan too? Did it even mattered what I've felt back then? What I went through?"

Sunset decided that she needs to step in. She placed a hoof on Starlight's shoulder, and saw hurt in her eyes. "Look, I do not know much about all this stuff, but it [i]did[/i] led you in a better place than you was in before, right?"

"I guess so," she replied in a small voice, and sniffed wetly.

"Back where I came from, you've become the princip—the [i]headmare[/i] of the Friendship School," Sunset said proudly, "You with Sunburst as your vice-headmare made a great team, helping a lot of students to find their way."

"A Friendship School, huh?" Starlight tried to smile, "I think Twilight would've absolutely loved it. And me and Sunburst, we were this close, working on something together? That seems unbelivable..."

Starswirl scoffed, stroking his beard, "Isn't that peculiar... Seems like a complete waste of resources." 

"Uh, if I'm not mistaken, you were enrolled in the School too," Sunset retorted, "Twilight was talking about how [i]even you[/i] were making strides in understanding Friendship. I'm sure "

"Sunset," Starlight suddenly asked, "what if things that you've experienced were some sort of magic construct too?"

"What?" Sunset blinked, taken aback by the suggestion.

"You seem to be from some alternate future, am I correct? I've seen something similar in my own time, and [i]he[/i]," Starlight nodded at old mage, "just said that this thing can be fabricated."

"I didn't said [i]that[/i]!" the old mage fervently defended himself, "And what's going on with [i]her[/i] is a completely different precedent. She isn't supposed to [i]be[/i] here! It's all that wedding and its distortion, it's that fulcrum event, that forced the whole paradigm to be changed!"

"A what now?" Sunset raised her ears curiously, "You mean everything changed, like with the pattern of the stars?"


First Compendium of Equestrian Laws



"Where is it?" he looked at them accusatory, his gruff voice sounded demandingly, "I've left it right there, right before I went to pick you up. Is it some clandestine ploy of yours? Did someone of you stole it?"

"Um, not me," Starlight replied sheepishly, and gave Sunset a pleading look. She shook her head violently in return.

"What is going on in here!?" Starswirl bellowed and took a step, glancing around, "Is this some joke? A [i]changeling[/i] magic?" He looked at his subordinates, "Is someone here working for the Queen?"

His horn flared with hot white aura, which quickly enveloped the room. Sunset recognized a complex revealing spell, intended to strip away illusions in a wide area.

As scared mares began to gawk at him and each other and utter words of denial, Starswirl recognized the futility of his actions and raised his foreleg: "Enough," and rubbed his forehead with it. "I think I know what it tied to, and perpetrator must be already long gone," he said grimly, "Time is of an essence, as always... Why I [i]must[/i] do everything by myself?..."

Starlight offered in a tense tone: "Master Starswirl, if you require any help from us, you should tell what's on your mind."



"What balance there can be without control? You want a world where everyone have a place? Everyone can realise their potential? Don't you ever crossed your mind that someone needs to fight for it, making tough decisions for you all to enjoy your lot in burden-free life,"


"And that is why there exist ponies like me, or Celestia, or Luna, or Twilight, so no one else would be forced to make these sacrifices,"


"Hope you are enjoying your little bipedal universe," he replied

"Would've enjoy it more, if you weren't tossing out there your own screw-ups, like the sirens," she growled back.

Starswirl rolled his eyes.


"You should smile more."

The time is happening concurrently. It doesn't have the identifiable past, present, and future. 

Старлайт прогоняет тесты и приходит в ужас. Оно детектит сотни путешественников во времени

"Do you want to distort time-space further?" Starswirl asked wryly, ""

"Because someone from the future is already trying to return back to this moment"

Старсвирл подавляет time-space distortions

Сансет приходит к выводу что она попала в параллельную вселенную

"Could I come from a parallel universe?" Sunset nervously offered.

"It might be plausible," Starlight rubbed her chin, frowning, but Starswirl shook his beard decisively:

"Absolutely not."

"But why?" Sunset blinked, "Everything is so different, that's gotta be it!"

"No," he replied combatively, "More likely something had scrambled your memories, than something like [i]that[/i] occured."

Behind his tone, Sunset noticed thoroughly concealed fear, and nodded just to placate the old guy. If he's so alarmed, she'll just try to fish the information from him later.

"Noithing to see here, just some childish frivolousness," Starswirl growled, "Was it one of you?"




"What do you mean?"

"I don't understand how you can use temporal magic for such frivolousness!"

What do you know about time travel?



Из материи ушел оживлявший её дух

Сансет изучает дерево пока на фоне Старсвирл пытается индоктринировать Старлайт

Затем он бежит к доске, переворачивает её, и пытается записать формулу, бросает это дело, и утелепортируется проверить кое-что

"No, it can be, too dangerous for you two." 


"There's something with the tree."

"What are you on about, child?"

"It is as if the animating spirit has gone out of its matter."

"Get away from there. This is beyond your comprehension--"

"Just look at it." She grabbed him by a beard, "See?"

Он видит что краешек листвы пожух


"Are you sure it was Discord?" Starlight asked nervously.

"I don't know. Does Discord's voice sounds creepy?" Sunset quipped.

"How creepy?"

"Evil creepy."

Starlight examined the statue. "He seems jovial. Like he is singing."

"What, Elements of Harmony hit him in the shower, or something?" Sunset rubbed her chin, pondering.

Starlight seemed to become stupefied from the mental image.

Sunset elaborated: "I mean, how [i]do[/i] you think Sisters got a drop on the guy? He is supposed to be omnipotent. You think he just sat around and [i]let[/i] it happen?" 

"Well, yes, he [i]could've[/i] been distracted by something," Starlight shrugged, "That's one theory, I guess."


Сансет трогает статую копытом. Ничего не происходит. She зябко поежилась, и повернула голову к Старлайт, убирая копыта.

"I kinda feel idiotic. I'm not sure what I even—"

Black hand grabbed her mid-sentence and whisked into the statue.

Starlight trembled and took a step back, before involuntarily unleashing her magic. A radiant ray lunched forward, demolishing the statue, as well as making long burning gap in the ground.

That black hand was [i]not normal[/i].

    I’ve enjoyed the way EqG takes a more egalitarian approach to who plays leader in any given special, as opposed to FiM becoming the Twilight show anytime the bad guy is sufficiently big.
