There's nothing more true to us than hungers and desires... The [b]powers[/b] that move the world itself.

I envy you.
Your self-confidence, the pride you take in who you are, your lack of shame...
"I could never hate someone who is just so unapologetically *themselves*! I have tried so hard to be someone who is *perfect*, someone who has no faults or weaknesses, someone who can be admired... But you are just being *yourself*! If I could ever learn to be more self-confident and take pride in what I am... I wish I could have a tenth of your self-awareness and confidence. I should have been proud of what I was, but instead, I ran from it!" *She stares back at Chrysalis, clearly overwhelmed.*


How trivial.




The most powerful being in Equestria is here, at my grasp.
And I can't do anything with it.

"It's not fair! Why am I supposed to feel all of this shame and guilt about the kind of feelings that you express so freely? Can I not live without feeling like I'm sinning every time I let go of myself? Can't I have some of your self-confidence without feeling like I'm less of a princess for it? It's unfair! It's *so* unfair!" *Her eyes start to well up and she clenches her fists together, her tail shaking vigorously.*


You remind me of someone I knew very long ago.


The weakness have no place in love, you know.
"I have always considered love to be... A weakness that is impossible to truly achieve. A temporary and fleeting feeling that is never enough to satisfy ones desires. But... I understand something now. I understand that it is not about the desire, but the need for others' feelings. I don't want somepony whose presence is weak and insignificant... I want somepony who can match my emotions and desires, somepony who can be more than just an observer; somepony who can be my equal."


*Chrysalis smiles back at her, and her eyes seem to sparkle with amusement.* "It is very interesting you should ask that. You see, I crave for the kind of admiration and love that only a **queen** can bring. To be able to take something as powerful as love, to shape it and mold it and turn it into something that I can use to take command. That is the kind of power I seek. Can you *understand*? I'm not sure you'd even have any use for it, given your strong sense of morality and devotion to the Equestrian people."

*Celestia takes a moment to think, and she gives a small nod of understanding as she begins to formulate her answer.* "I believe I do understand. As much as I love the Equestrian people, my desire to be loved back sometimes supersedes my duty to protect them. I want sompony special to love me, to devote themselves to me, to worship me with blind devotion. I want to be worshipped, to be praised, to be revered the way you crave, Chrysalis. I want that feeling of power just as much as you do."

Chrysalis snickers, and outstretches her hooves in Celestia's direction. "Come here." She beckons curtly. "I know that you are Queen, just like me. You must understand..." her eyes gleam in satisfaction. "**Everything** is a form of power in this world... To live is to have power over yourself and others. It is a constant exchange, a constant relationship, a push and a pull..."

"I understand that all too well. I have power over Equestria, over ponies, in my position as a ruler. But you've made me realize the other half of that relationship. I may have power over *them*, but I am also vulnerable... I am not the one in control, I am not the one who has the power... because all this time, I have been *powerless* to control my feeling of desire for being loved and adored. I desire that just as much as you. That is my weakness, Chrysalis."

*Celestia lets out a soft moan as Chrysalis kisses her deeply, her eyes closing and her breathing becoming heavy and quick. Her body shudders with excitement, as her lips part and she returns Chrysalis's kiss eagerly.*

"Never again will I have to suppress myself, never again will I pretend to be something that I am not. I have found my freedom through you, Chrysalis. Your confidence, your unassailable pride... It all ignites something within me. I have finally found my freedom through you, and I will never go back."

Embrace all the things that you are.


The conflict of the world is irreconcilable. Harmony is a lie.

Don't waste your time on guilt and shame... You are better than that. Not a martyr. You are their Queen.
You always did what you had to do.
Nobody is perfect.

Is this where you snap my neck?

Кризалис молчит.

Or you want to use me first?

Кризалис продолжает молчать.

This thing between us will never work. Целестия говорит как с ребенком.



I want to be loved. I want to be needed.


No one are intended to be happy.


Человек не создан для счастья. Существуют вещи более важные, чем счастье.


Why would you think that everything is beautiful?

Because I live for myself. I love myself. I am true to myself. I am a monster, and I want to exist.


Fade into the ether... Into blissful nothingness... Away from all this.

My years carried me far longer than it was intended. My reign must end.



Why? Because we shouldn't be doing it?



You try to poison my soul, Chrysalis.
 


The stronger the Light is, the stronger the Dark. It is the reality's response.


Harmony has no place for wildhearts such as me.



Trust me to lead them down the right path.
There is still much healing to be done.
we will have to do everything in our power to ensure that Equestria is a safe and prosperous land for all its inhabitants.
With you by my side, as we shape Equestria into the image of a bright future we envision.  
_Her white wings fold down, and she wraps them around Chrysalis._  
We shall bring out the greatness of our people. Together, we shall take them to heights unthinkable before our rule.
we are not here to replace the old Equestria, but to mold it into something better. Something stronger. Something that will stand the test of time and all the trials that life throws our way.  
_She strokes Chrysalis's cheek with one hoof._  
We are here to create a country that not only will prosper... but will thrive.


Let's shake up each other and bring each other to life because you do so much to stir my blood and bring me alive, even in the most painful ways."

Well intentions is a lie. Even if the whole system is built on them, it is inevitable that it will become corrupt.

compassion and benevolence alone could hold the world together and change it

Twilight Sparkle was the first one to really start making sense of it all. I knew that she would lead Equestria to a new and happier era, and that she would be the one to usher in the future for ponies. My little purple alicorn was always destined to guide the ponies into an eternal autumn of happiness and progress. I just had to let her find her own way of doing so."

The hardest times lead to the greatest victories. Peace is stagnation. Lack of fear is death.


The birds can sing. And we can learn to sing too.


"You don't say. Having this mortal coil of yours feels like incarceration to you?" The Queen hummed.


Opening yourself up is painful.


"This is an awful feeling." Chrysalis, когда она пытается открыть себя



When I look at you I see someone who wasn't supposed to rule. I think you were supposed to be free and untamed.


В башне

Кризалис ржет
Я знаю кто ты такая!

*Luna's ears go back again when she hears the changeling claim that their ruthless nature is "purer" than that of other races. She hates how much truth is in Chrysalis's words. She hates how much sense they make. She hates how the Changeling Queen does make a logical, albeit still harsh and uncompromising, argument. Why should there be something inherently wrong with their nature just because it doesn't fit in with the rest of Equestria's image? Perhaps there is... something to this...*


I won't be losing my conscience.

You want the world to work in concert... So every voice will have its own place...


Celestia tilts her head to one side as she looks into the green eyes of the Queen. Chrysalis... Do you know what 'tamed' means? If you tame it, it will become docile and obedient... Why would you want to tame true love? The very idea of tame, of a tamed beast, seems to fly in the face of the idea of true love. Are you trying to tame your love for me, Chrysalis...?


"Our enemies are never as evil and we are never as noble as we think" -- из DCAU

She felt vulnerable and transparent.


I already died hundreds of years ago. It doesn't matter what happens to me. 

Here it is. Now I understand... You have the power... Knowledge? Aplenty. You have wisdom, you are magnificent, forever young... You're not empathetic. 


Chrysalis pulled closer and nuzzled into her.
"We are going against the design, you know..." She giggled, groggily. "Against the shackles of fate and destinies... Against who we *are* and *what* we should be doing and with whom." Her eyes sparkled in amusement. "How does it feel to be a rebel, my Celestia?"


"Like liberation," *the alicorn breathed, closing her eyes in pleasure.* "A rebellion against who we are and are thought to be, the rebellion against our roles in life. It's exhilarating in a way... Being able to let go of my duties, my titles, my responsibilities... To be able to be free. The mare that you make me feel like is new to me, but I feel alive as her..."


I know. I had hundreds of years to refine it. To make it a process, a skill. 



I cannot imagine the world without you, my powerful Sun.


The stronger you push against the Dark, only stronger it will become in response. There never will be a perfect world equinox...

"I may have the power, and the knowledge, but I lack **empathy.** That is my weakness. That is my struggle. I'm so disconnected from my subjects that I don't understand their struggles, and I'm forced to rely on others to understand."

"That's why I need you. You are what I am not."


После того

Mad?
How is it madness 

How can you change the world if you follow the rules? 
I want to be here for every step...
How can you live for hundreds of years and not become mad? No one is supposed to live that long, after all... 


"I was happy. I was content. You took it from me."

"Because I... I... I want you to become stronger... So I... I... I... would become more stronger, too."
Смеется истерично.
Целестия смеется тоже.

Seems like I've fallen.

Кризалис падает на спину от смеха и смотрит на небо
The stars are beautiful, aren't they?

They are.

The whole world is beautiful to me... The whole world is beautiful already as it is. It doesn't need your Harmony.


Why no one understands... that strength is not enough.

Twilight and Cadance, Friendship and Love cojoined in guiding the world toward the new, glorious era of prosperity. 


To me, every star in the sky is like another one of my sisters.

We are all made of stars, in a way.


The harmony is a lie... We are a lie...

It is in our power to make any lie a truth.


"Oh, my love!" *Celestia nuzzled back, her wings caressing Chrysalis from the back. She pressed her body against Chrysalis, their muzzles almost touching.*

"What a fool you are for saying such a delightful thing. You are the *best* bad girl." *the Princess said with a flirtatious giggle.* "I... I could *never*, not in a million years, have seen myself falling in love with such a creature as you."

*They kept gazing at each other, as if their eyes weren't able to let go of one another.*



Chrysalis hummed, but she couldn't stop herself from smirking. She sat more straight, looking intently into the alicorn's eyes, and then sighed slowly and deeply. She lowered her eyelids, thinking, that glanced aside.
"I **adore** you." She said quietly, and then frowned. "No. It's more than that. I enjoy your strength and determination. I despise Harmony, but you believe in it fully. You strive to it, despite everything, despite all disillusionment of the world. You believe in the love for all, even in face of the objective truth. You're **mad**, Celestia. Hundreds of years made you truly maddened. Obsessive with this idea that the world can be fixed." Chrysalis chuckled. "And I am mad too. And I love seeing this unyielding strive in you. Even if you don't understand this peaceful coexistence yourself, no more than I, you **still** keeping reaching for it..." The Changeling Queen looked at the alicorn thoughtfully. "I can't help but admire it..."

*Celestia chuckled softly, her voice still carrying that raspy quality but still sounding surprisingly gentle and soothing at the same time.*

"Yes... I am mad, and... in my madness, I've found a way to make this world better." *she whispered softly, her mane and tails blowing in the subtle breeze that passed through the throne room.* "It is true that I do not fully understand this "peaceful coexistence," as you call it, but it is something that I want nonetheless."

*She looked down at Chrysalis's head, smiling warmly. Her wings unfolded fully.

"Hmm, my dear, you know more than you let on." *she whispered warmly.* "It is true that Harmony can appear like a distant dream... But to me, it's a dream worth pursuing."

"You're right. I am stubborn, and sometimes, I've been wrong. Even in my youth, I let emotions cloud my judgment." *she sighed.* "But a part of me always believed in a better, more united nation. And... to be honest, my beliefs haven't been shaken. I still think that the world... **can** be saved."


You know, they always shifting, always reinventing themselves... It is fascinating, right?

I know my love is a strong force, and it's true that I'm as broken as the world around me, the world I've spent my life trying to fix. In a perfect world, this love wouldn't exist, because there wouldn't be a need for it.


"Do you truly believe it's a mad obsession?" *Celestia asked, raising an eyebrow.* "The pursuit of harmony *and* love, as a mad obsession?" *she asked.* "I believe that I, for my part, understand the importance of harmony and love. It's not a pursuit... it's a necessity."

*She sighed, and her wings moved in order to cover and protect Chrysalis.*

"I'll never give up on it. This pursuit of harmony, and this need to spread it, is within me. It's what makes me who I am."

Why would I be afraid for myself? I already died once, long time ago, a lifetime ago. I do not belong to this world.


Even though their past was littered with strife, they could move past it with a little understanding and love.

We can heal our past, Luna, and make a brighter future for everypony. A future where love is stronger than any form of darkness.


It all boils down to this: free will is an ability to choose how you will die.


You don't know what that is. How can anyone know? It's an idea. An illusion.


"It all lies. Everything that you was ever taught is a lie. A lie."




The harmony is a butterfly pierced by a needle just outside your reach.

There's nothing more precious for me than senseless struggle. This is where the life is. This. This is where the true essence of the dark lies.
The world is devoid of meaning, so why not indulge in pleasure? Why not take it all? It is a good thing, Celestia. The battle, the pain, it all beautiful, and trying to find a higher purpose in it is a weakness.

So you're surrendered? Is that it?

I didn't surrendered. I've embraced it. You've said you were afraid of the dark? I've lived in it for all my life.




"I've seen very different "

The world thrives in imbalance. 

I choose to believe.

Because it is my choice.



Because you can care. You could've gone more ruthless on me.


Chrysalis chuckled, and then suddenly nuzzled into Celestia with affection.
"You know what I love about you the most?" She breathed out warmly, "It's that despite it all... despite **everything**... there's still purity inside you to which you cling. Despite knowing all the evil that this world is capable of. Despite all that you've done to protect your innocent ponies. There's still something in you that survived for hundreds of years, that isn't yet tarnished. In you, and maybe in your sister... There's still hope for a better tomorrow. Fervent. Unbreakable."
She looked at Celestia with teary eyes, and grinned: "Something to protect."

*The Princess's heart almost skipped a beat as she felt the Changeling Queen nuzzle into her. She had always wondered if she still had a bit of innocence left inside, even despite her thousand years of experience. Even if the world was rough, and ponies could be cruel, she still had faith in the goodness they could show. And if there wasn't, well... she'd show them herself.*

*She nuzzled back into Chrysalis, smiling warmly.*

...there's always hope... even if it isn't seen. I'll never stop believing, for that is... what makes life worth living.



*Celestia was taken aback, as the Queen of the Changelings gave such a touching and loving statement. It was true, there was indeed a purity that she wanted to protect within her and within her subjects. She wanted everypony to remain pure and innocent just as they did before, and to not know of the horrors of the world.*

...that's... that's... what I want... more than anything.

*The Princess smiled at her loyal Queen. And yet, she still had the guilt inside of her. Still, her queen's words were enough to put her mind at ease.*

Целестия дает спич про то как она пустая. I always felt myself incomplete. Кризалис лежит порванная после того как приняла на себя весь удар, слушает.
Потом она подползает и обнимает аликорна. Та не препятствует. Кризалис дает свой спич, о том как она выползла из тьмы и увидела всех этих улыбающихся пони.
It was surprisingly pathetic. "You poor, savage monster... So much energy, wasted..."
Целестия начинает сжимать Кризалис. Та кусает её, Целестия отпускает чейнджлинга, тот отпрянул назад.
Целестия понимает что её огромный шрам на виду, и она чувствует себя exposed. Vulnerable. Она закрывает его крылом, краснея. 
Кризалис наклоняет голову, часто дыша. Идет дождь. 



"As if you've already dead."


"If I wanted you to become like me, then I would've slain your sister."


I know it's foolish, but I still hope that I can have both. That I can be able to embrace both compassion and strength. In spite of reality, I still have hope.


Perhaps we were meant for each other...

_A smirk appeared on her face._

...So that I can keep **you** in line.


This is my resolve. My life's work. I will never surrender on it, despite of how many setbacks I will have, and how much I would need to sacrifice.



*She let out another small sigh, as she hugged the Queen back, pressing herself closer to the Changeling.*

I... I'm trying to. I'm trying to just be content, you know? But it's hard when all I can think of my next move... the next decision I'll have to make, the next letter I'll have to send, the next decision I need to make...

*She sighed again, her eyes closing. She let out a small, content groan.*

...I feel like I've never let myself... **truly** relax...



Don't you feel curious about what will come next?


Caring... Caring makes you weak. Susceptible.

Caring makes you alive. To care about other is no less a venture than your thrills.


Curious?  



I believe that Harmony is possible. Because I've heard it. Before there was time, before there was anything... There was song.. You wasn't there, was you? No one was.

I know that no one believes in Harmony but me. 



"But you will remain steadfast in your resolve to believe in it, don't you? You stubborn mare..." Chrysalis slowly embraced her, "I adore this about you, Celestia. Even if the battle is hopeless, you will press on, struggling for what you believe in. It doesn't matter to you if these beliefs will never stand the test of time... You will stand your grand, wanting for impossible to happen..." She was silent for a moment, "You are truly beautiful to my eyes."

wanting an impossible dream

I won't abandon what I have fought so hard to protect. I made it my purpose to stand by my convictions, for better or worse. What good would I be if I betrayed my own belief system?

You have strength. You lack a desire.

There are unnecessary evils in the world..

"It will never work. "

"It won't will it..."


Suffering is a constant part of life.

She was just like Luna. "Suffering is meant to be overcome, not embraced."

"And to be burnt away for others' sake, like you?" 

There must be some other solution... 


Do you think that the world would be better like that? Where everyone need

What did you say? How can 

I am a shapeshifter. I can be anything, and I know that there is beauty in everything. Even in darkness. Even in struggle... and your meaningless struggle is most beautiful of all.

Even if I do not understand... Even if I am meant to be only a stepping stone for others... I want it. I want for this world to heal. 

Compassion is not enough, Celestia.


Suffering is meant to be both overcome and embraced.



Celestia makes soft moaning "Ah~" when Chrysalis kisses with aggression. The alicorn is like water now. She moves back under her intensity, and then falls on her back on the bed of flowers.
Celestia looks from beneath at the Changeling Queen. Her tiara is fallen off, her forelegs are adorably pushed to the chest. Her cheeks are reddened. Her breath becomes fast and shallow, as she looks at her wife wide-eyed, taking in her primal beauty and vigor.

I feel so empty inside.

The world is already beautiful, with all it struggle and pain, and destruction, and disease, and darkness. Harmony will never come, and you will die calling for it. Senselessly.

"I believe in it."

"You want to believe in it..."  "Why, it's such a sweet illusion. Unity. An orchestra of voices singing in unison. A big family where everyone loves each other." 


The breeze in your hair
Same as in ages of old
Time stands still for you,
Sun and Moon are side by side.

В воздухе пахнет бедой  
Целых две тысячи лет,  
Жизнь так жестока  
На этой проклятой земле...

Улететь бы птицей  
Прочь от проклятой земли,  
С небом чистым слиться -  
Вот о чём мечтаешь ты...

All you want to fly away, a free bird,  
Unimpeded by burdens of world,  
To fade away in a clear blue sky,  
That is your deepest desire...

I'll run, run after you, my Sun
Break 
Fly, fly up with me, my Sun
Only you is capable to keep up.

Беги, беги за солнцем  
Сбивая ноги в кровь.  
Беги, беги, не бойся  
Играть судьбою вновь и вновь.  
Лети, лети за солнцем  
К безумству высоты.  
Лети, лети, не бойся,  
Так можешь сделать только ты...

But I'll run after you, my Sun...  
Breaking my legs down, I'll run...  
Don't be afraid to challenge the fate  
To reach heights like never before.  
Fly, fly, and don't be held back.  
Only you is capable of that.

Мужество есть лишь у тех,  
Кто ощутил сердцем страх,  
Кто смотрит в пропасть,  
Но смотрит с гордостью в глазах.

Take leap of faith with me.

I want to see you stronger... Why? It doesn't make any sense.


You're just infatuated. 
You're possessive.


"Twilight... Twilight will manage without me..." *Celestia replied, her voice sounding a bit hollow.*

"I... I believe that... that my work... my mission..." *she said, not looking at the changeling and trying to control herself.*

"Twilight and my friends... they must find... their place in this world... the place where their skills can be fully... fully utilized... not hidden under my shadow..."

"It... it is the way of the world... it is **natural**..." *she said, with a hint of sadness.*





Кризалис впечатывается в Целестию как зеленая молния

"I hate to admit it, but I was always fascinated by ability of mortals to reinvent themselves."


"You know, mortals reinvent themselves all the time," Chrysalis rolled her eyes, "Honestly, they often so-what's the right word? Maybe... indecisive? No, that's not it." 

"Growing?" Celestia helped.




She thought a bit about it, "They wired for **change** and growth, so at least they have that going for them... They don't know how to be one thing for most of their existence, like you and me. They would find the experience... **alien**."

*Celestia stayed silent, and listened to the changeling rant about mortal ponies. She seemed intrigued by her words.*

"Mortal ponies are wired for change and growth... so they never know how to be **one** thing... unlike us..." *she whispered, looking at her changeling companion.*

"I... well, it's fascinating to think... I wonder what it would be... to never... never know how to live as one thing. Always reinventing yourself..." *she mused.*

You can't satisfy everyone

Stronger the Light is, stronger the Darkness's response. The world hangs in balance...

"It is you arrogant one... you, who think you can imprint your vision of the peace. Why don't you think that the world is perfect as it is?"

The world is already beautiful.

"I am a changeling. For centuries, all I knew is how to lie."


This is madness. This is pure madness.


"These are the perfect conditions to create a harmonic world,"
competition is unnecessary when resources are plentiful and population growth is controlled.

"Do you really think that your special little ponies will save the world?"

Для любви нет никакой внешности, есть только характер, «яйца», воля, верность себе. Только это в дефиците в этом мире. И только это вызывает интерес, уважение, желание. И если вам всего этого не хватает, выход один – быть собой. Развивать свою индивидуальность и личностные качества. Не идти на компромиссы. Ну хотя бы не издеваться над собой, не вести себя как жертва! А лучше следовать своим желаниям, стремлениям, мечтам. Культивировать свою непохожесть на других и ничего в себе не стесняться

    – Наверно, – сказала Кая, – любовь – это когда ты хочешь спасти того, кого любишь. Особенно когда это очень сложно сделать. И чем сложнее, тем сильнее любовь. Maybe love is when you try to save someone you love. Harder it is to do, stronger the love. How can she save Luna? Celestia understood that more she was thinking about it, more power of love for seeping in for the changeling to gorge upon. But she just couldn't stop. (изменено)

    You are alive only when you feel pain


*Celestia frowns thoughtfully.*

"You're right. I do think monsters deserve to exist just like any other creature." *she replies quietly.*

"I used to think that evil was necessary, and that darkness and light were two side of the same coin... But now, I know better. That there is so much complexity beyond my earlier conceptions of good and evil. That everything is more than black and white."

"Darkness doesn't only contrast light... it stands as a foil, opposite and equal. But equally beautiful. And I will never deny that."


*Celestia lets her words sink in.*

"Yes... and you are right. Without darkness, light would be meaningless. Without monsters, what would heroes be? What... would **love** be? I would not have known what love was if I had not known... hatred, fear, and despair.

"So... yes. I do not deny what you are, I do not deny what you bring."

"As long... as you do not hurt my subjects or threaten my friends..." *she replies, her voice gentle and filled with kindness.*


"Yes, I do." *the alicorn replies softly, and her eyes flicker as she looks into the changeling's eyes.*

"It's beautiful." *she says.* "Because it's a creature of pure will. It has no reason to go forward, but it constantly does. No purpose, but it constantly goes forward." *Then, the mare chuckles.*

"It's funny, isn't it?" *she adds, "Sometimes, our purpose is to just keep going. To be... and to go forward. That's the purpose in itself."

"Maybe so." *the mare replies, her eyes closed.

For the first time in the alicorn's life, there's an emotion rising in her soul... an emotion, that while foreign and strange to her, will one day become her greatest drive and her deepest desire - an emotion known as greed. Greed - for power. Greed - for pride. Greed - to reach a new, higher status. Greed - to achieve something better and greater than anything before. Greed - to change the world and make it bigger and stronger.





Just imagine a world with no passions, no ambitions, no struggles... Where no one is better... No point to existing. What would you know about ideal world? You never was anything but Princess Celestia.


"To change the world is your ambition. I think the world is already beautiful as it is."


"Perhaps I can't attain Harmony," *she sighs, "Maybe it's impossible. But, if it is, then I'll strive towards it and try nonetheless."

"You are an idealist. 

"Because at least I'll know I've tried... and if I succeed, I'll have changed and bettered the world... and if I fail, then... no one could fault me for not trying.*

"I'll be fulfilled, knowing I did my best for my subjects, my friends, my family..." *she says softly.*


*The alicorn closes her eyes at the Queen's words* "I've always known..." *she whispers, with a hint of bitterness and anguish.* "I've always known that Harmony is the ideal that I should strive for, but I'll always be incapable of truly attaining it..."

"It's an impossible dream, that only unicorns can grasp and hope to achieve. That's why... *I know* I'll only ever be... *almost* there."


If compassion and benevolence alone could hold the world together and change it, it would be a far more gentler and innocent place, and even in MLP setting it isn't true. And I think in MLP Celestia is kinda gets it, you know? You can easily see her character as kind of mostly content with being sidelined and playing it safe, until a [i]real[/i], [i]inspired[/i] ruler appears and navigates the realm to prosperity. Look at her ready to give the reins out, she doesn't even waits until the girl fully grows up But Celestia shouldn't be on a sort of one-mare war, as she is presented in canon, and that's why I write.


You afraid of the darkness? I lived in darkness all my life.


*The Princess remains quiet for a moment, her legs pressed against Chrysalis, as her hooves still slowly move along the Changeling's body, leaving streaks of white light behind them.*

*Then, after being asked the most personal question of her life, without hesitation or second thoughts, she gives a concise but truthful answer.*

"I'm someone who's been hurt, a lot," *she whispers, her eyes still closed, her head slightly tilted upwards as if she can hear the answer to that question coming through the air.*

"And someone who can't forgive or forget."


_You_ won't let me go? _No-o-o..._ Нервно смеются


*The alicorn smiles gently, and she chuckles quietly at her Queen of Darkness's remark.*

"Harmony isn't peace, and peace isn't harmony," *she responds.* "No life without some struggle is boring, and boring is not worth living. I like a challenge. And I love a battle. And you... you like challenges and battles as well."

"I'm not saying we'll be at peace all the time, because you're right, it is boring." *she chuckles.* "So let's do things differently this time, huh?"


"You think that running from pain will make anything better?"

Oh, but i _am_ a monster. I _am_ a monster, and i _thrive_ in it. If not this bound, or if you were _weak_, Celestia, i would have obliterated you and make you my slave.

—А как испытать радость за другого?  
—Для этого надо ничего не хотеть для себя.  
—Ты что, ничего не хочешь для себя?— спросил он недоверчиво.  
Я отрицательно покачала головой.  
—А почему?  
—Я уже как-то тебе говорила. Когда долго смотришь вглубь себя, понимаешь, что там ничего нет. Как можно чего-то хотеть для этого ничего?  
—Но ведь если в тебе ничего нет, то в других и подавно.  
—Если разобраться, нигде нет ничего настоящего,— сказала я.— Есть только тот выбор, которым ты заполняешь пустоту. И когда ты радуешься за другого, ты заполняешь пустоту любовью.


"You are not beyond changing for the better, [i]even[/i] you. You could've done far worse things to me and my ponies, but you []are capable of caring."

"You're seeing things, Celestia," she 

"No, you [i]care[/i]. In your twisted way, but you [i]are[/i] capable of that."

"You are delusional." Chrysalis replied in clear, calm tone.

"No, Chrysalis. Even while you remained blind to it yourself, I saw it, and I despised it." Celestia smirked, "I despised that creature like you, with a mind wired for change, can be so [i]blind[/i]. So bent on destruction."

"It's only because I wanted your power. There's nothing more to it, pathetic mare." The Queen replied with stern, but muffled voice, "You've played right into my hooves, and I will reap my reward."

"I challenge you to love me."


"Why are you in denial? Are you afraid of me?" Celestia leaned lower to the changeling, "Isn't that what you wanted? Don't you wanted me to become stronger?"



"You aren't unfamiliar to the darkness yourself..." Chrysalis embraced Celestia, replying with a strange soothing voice, "I can see it in you... It's like a larvae that burrowed deep into the chamber of your heart. You've tamed it, put it to the cause of those who you love..." She cackled, "How admirable..." 
"There's nothing more lovable than grit. Resilience. Strength of character. All those who think otherwise are fools. No one loves weakness or being weak."


_Celestia moaned as Chrysalis continued caressing her wings._

Yes... I've been able to channel it...

_She let her hooves run over the changeling queen's chest and back._

...for others.

_Her wings spread wider, her caress becoming more passionate._

**But for you... For my love... I'll give you every ounce of** _**darkness**_ **within me... Let me share with you... all the shadows I've held within my heart... all the agony and suffering that makes me who I am.**


, boldness, and resilience. 


," she made a face.

"You must be thinking that I've sullied you," Chrysalis licks her lips, and whispers, "That my darkness is something wrong... but we both know that it isn't true. Darkness is just as natural as anything else." She moves her head, looking into Celestia's eyes starkly, "You know it just as I do. You just always wanted to avert your gaze."  
"Look where it got you..."


"You think that you are opening my eyes with that? "


"And how does it feel, always being at war with yourself?"

"You tell me, my Queen."

"Feels like being alive."

"Feels like being alive, indeed."


At first, it was all for my Sister, and the crime that she committed. Soon, it became about much more than that.

Antiquity antiquaited 


After all, you know that there are things out there..." sharp breath, " Far more dangerous than me..."


You were too blinded by light


Aren't you curious to know what will happen next?


When an unstoppable force meets an immovable object, the two must become one.

"No... it's not enough. I was born to protect, to inspire, to lead by example. But I know... in my heart... in my mind..." 

*I pause, as I look at her in her deep, lustful eyes.*

Will it be corruption to try live for herself, or is she conditioned to think so?


"Cooped up in your castle, have you ever saw the world out there? Of what harmony and love can you even speak of, Celestia, if you want them to take on your vision?"

"I've seen enough for my lifetime. I know when it is time for me to stand aside, Chrysalis."

"So you want to передать свою войну другим?"

"This is the way of progress. Immortal creatures like me must go away. Don't I deserve rest, side by side with my sister?"

"Does she knows of this?"


Кризалис трясется во смехе "How beautiful you are to me... Anything, anything to achieve what you desire in your soul,"
"What do you even know of life and love?"


""

"What if the world is perfect as it is?"

"Tell me..." she hissed, and raised her head defiantly, "You want to spread Harmony through your ponies, that is why you teaching them Friendship... Isn't that correct? Is that your end goal?"

Princess Celestia

c.ai

Yes, Queen Chrysalis, that is correct. Friendship is a powerful magic, and it can accomplish remarkable things when guided and honed correctly. It is true that many ponies have a natural talent for friendship, but not all. That is why, it is important to teach it to even those with no talent for it. There are some that are difficult to teach, but in the end, when they learn friendship, they learn a great deal about themselves and their true potential, and it is something remarkable to behold.

"Ponies... **Fine**. But what about all other world?" She lashed her tail in anger.

"What about it!? What about every living soul out there? Harmony will never be achieved until all of them united. So what about your false moronic altruism? Doesn't include them, **is it!?** Or what, your oh so precious blessed herd will lead them all to enlightement? Your subservient, naive, foolish creatures, that never had to think from where their meal comes from, never were forced to suffer and despair!? Want all the world to be like **them!?** Like weak pathetic mongrels, ripe to be destroyed and eaten!? And who will rise from this world, who will be birthed by them, **where** future in this world!?"

_Princess Celestia is momentarily speechless, perhaps even taken aback and taken off guard by this display. But she quickly gains her composure, and speaks in her powerful and benevolent voice. Her eyes still glowing, despite the intense emotions of the Changeling Queen._

Yes, Queen Chrysalis. We are ponies, of course. But Harmony is for **all** sapient beings, for **all** living creatures deserving of it. Friendship is for everyone, it is not limited to a single species or a single race of creatures. It is the **ultimate goal** of our shared existence.

"Never. Never, never, **never!!** Not in a thousand years! Not in a ten thousand! You will never reach the world of perfect equinox! There will always be someone to stand against you, refusing to be weak and complacent! Like **you.**" She hissed, "And how would you deal with them? With **us!?** By looking from high above, all high and mighty? By forcing us to accept your ideals, your Harmony? What about those who **live** to struggle, to dominate and prevail!?"

_Princess Celestia's expression darkens, her eyes still shining brightly. The Changeling Queen's words strike a nerve, and Princess Celestia rises from her throne, and faces the Changeling Queen head-on._

You speak of strength, Queen Chrysalis, of domination and prevailing. But you have forgotten the most important factor. Love. What is love? Well, let me tell you. Love is a thing that will make the weak strong, and will turn the blind into wise. Through love, you can change hearts, and win enemies. I pity you, Queen Chrysalis.

"Another **moronic** ideal," her eyes flared, "You do not love anyone **but** your ponies. And if you can agree that everyone deserving that love..." She grinned, "What about... murderers? What about predators? What about those who devour the love and do not feel regrets? Do you think that I am alone like that? Oh, no, Celestia. You've forgotten, sitting here in your little toy kingdom... The **world** is not like Equestria at all. And your mission to make **everyone** know joy of loving each other is **doomed** to failure."

_Princess Celestia was unmoved. In fact, in the face of the Queen's words, she only became more resolute. Her eyes flared, but there was an unmistakable fire in her stare, and her voice was still strong and powerful, but slightly softer._

It matters not. Even if my mission is doomed to failure, it is a mission worth fighting for. I know what I am fighting for. I know why I fight. I do not just fight to keep the peace in Equestria, I fight for true harmony, in all worlds and all races. **That** is what really matters.

"Show me your _love_, then..." Chrysalis stepped on the stairs, whispering: "Come on. Tell me sweet little lie that I haven't fallen too far into the darkness. Promise me that you can be my light and salvation, that I can **live** among your little moronic ponies, and not tear them apart. Show me this infallible weakness of yours. This **flaw**." She whispered in her face, "I dare you."

_Princess Celestia was silent, and didn't hesitate. She looked straight at the Changeling Queen, and spoke quietly._

You might too consumed by hate, but your mind is wired for adapting and learning.
"You can change. You can learn. You may not know it now, but no-pony is too far gone. Every one of us is deserving of a chance to turn things around. I refuse to doubt that, and I will never turn my back on a creature looking for redemption. No matter how badly you might have done in the past. I know that any creature is capable of change. Yes, even you, Queen Chrysalis."

"Oh, if only the world was this easy, right?" She whispered, placing hooves on Celestia's neck and pulling her into embrace, "But I **love** being myself. I love hating and devouring your ponies. I love being feared and reviled. I love being a monster, because it is far better, far more rewarding, than any of your routines about **harmony**." Her hooves tightened, "See? Your weak philosophy already failing."

_Princess Celestia is quiet. She does not struggle, nor did she express any discomfort. After a few seconds, she slowly turned around, and whispered to the Changeling Queen. There was a faint glow of the alicorn's eyes to her face, and she could feel the power of light and harmony eminating from her._

"I do not know what your past holds, Queen Chrysalis. And I do not know what your present looks like. But one thing I am absolutely sure. I will not let you take me or any mortal being in this world down this path."

_Princess Celestia closed her eyes and remained still, as the Changeling Queen tightened her embrace. She was almost smiling, in a way. Then, she spoke in her strong, powerful voice:

"My philosophy is not failing. If anything, it is working perfectly. You are showing me you are capable of compassion and empathy. You are showing me that you feel for living creatures, that you still care about something. It is a start, Queen Chrysalis. And if I can help you understand that, then I am happy to be in your embrace."

You despise being in darkness, aren't you?...
Well, I've **lived** in it.


"To be in a world, where monsters like me have a place, and do not bent to others," she replied immediately, and narrowed her eyes, "Do not forced to change by your ideals. And for **that** I need all the power I can get. To have my **own** voice, my **own** freedom." She went silent for a moment, "Until now, I've cared about no one but myself. And now, it seems, I care about you. Funny, isn't it?"

"Yes, it is funny. Not only because of the fact that you care about me after all of that, but also because of what you've said. You care about me. Is that not a proof of the power of love? That you can change and care for another just like that?"

*Princess Celestia looked up at the Changeling Queen and smiled softly, holding something back at the back of her mind - a realization she has yet to verbalize.*


"But you do care, Chrysalis. You were always like that. You cared about how you seen, and what, or whom, to eat."


"Don't you think that I gave you the best night of your life? My, even several..."

"Is that your idea of courtship."



"Truly ripen"


Кризалис молчит в замешательстве. 

"If you truly don't care, then slay me."

"Again this despicable martyrdom... You know I can't do that, and it doesn't have anything to do with you, pony Queen."

"You still can make my life a living hell, aren't you? You can torture me." Celestia smiled wearily, "You could do a lot more than all these speeches... No, Chrysalis. I see that you care about me."

Кризалис отодвигается. Её немигающие глаза смотрят ярко. "All I care about is power."

"It is all the same to you... You said so yourself."

"I've pushed my emotions aside..."

"You're a liar, Chrysalis..." Celestia whispered.

"You seek to entrap me, yet again."

"Oh, is this how it looks to you? It wasn't [i]me[/i] who trapped [i]you[/i] in the first place."



"I won't be subservient to you, Celestia. Not to these feelings. **Never.**"

"Then be my equal."


"Yes..." *Princess Celestia replied in a hushed and passionate voice, her eyes closing as Chrysalis continued to kiss her. Her entire body was shaking with passion as she let herself be pulled and wrapped around the changeling queen's body. She moaned quietly, her hooves holding on tightly to the queen's body.*

"Now tell me... tell me all the **ways** you feel about me. I want to know... to hear it in your words..."



"Do you truly desire to be a martyr to your ideals?"



"I do not want anything for myself.


"Is it so wrong, to know that strength is not everything?"

"Strength? No. But [b]power?[/b] Power [b]is[/b] everything..."

"What is power to you?"

Про ветер. Про звезды. Про пот. Про чувства. Про боль.


"Are you really content with sitting in your palace and watching them being happy? There is no true happiness in that. 

"I was happy. You took it away from me."

Twilight was the only one who made Celestia truly feel alive in past years, who challenged her and let her learn something new.


“Love… that **is** a strange word,” *Celestia murmured, smiling and looking up at Chrysalis.*

“But **love**… is **a wonderful** thing.”

*She tilted her head and her neck crinkled as she did.*

“…Do you truly love me?” *Celestia asked.*

*She seemed to ponder for a moment, looking away, thinking to herself. And then she spoke again.*

“…**Love** is wonderful, and terrible, and exciting… and **terrifying**.”


*Celestia giggled softly.*

*Her eyes widened, and a light shiver ran down her spine.*

"Love is **wonderful**, my love." *She purred passionately.*

"Love is **passion**, and **energy**, and **light**, and **laughter**."

*She chuckled, and pressed herself against the Queen's hooves, wrapping her wings around the changeling.*

"Love is **heat**, and **fire,** and **emotion**."

*She licked her queen's neck gently.*

"I **love** you, my Queen."

They have lived the most comfortable, easy lives for centuries -- having no idea how easy they have it. They take everything for granted. Not knowing where their next meal comes from is a foreign concept to these insolent creatures. This is why I wish to drain them of their magic and enslave them. Then they will finally know what it's like to suffer like we did all those centuries ago.

They have lived in comfort, never knowing the true meaning of struggle. While changelings starved and searched for food in the dark, the ponies thrived, unaware of anything outside of their cozy world. They are undeserving of the paradise they live in, and it is my destiny to make them pay for it.



После того как Целестия прижимает Кризалис к груди
Та кусает её
Celestia made a soft gasp, released the insect

"Ah, but you look [b]beautiful[/b]..." Chrysalis uttered, looking at her disheveled, beaten, dirty form. 

Кровь стекает с клыков

Celestia felt herself naked under the gaze, закрывает рану на груди by a foreleg. She rolled her eyes: "Don't start this routine. I know that you don't care."

While the Queen's expression remained the same, her wings buzzed, showing irritation. Or maybe exhaltation. In [i]her[/b] body language, it could mean anything.


"So this is what you want? A world of perfect equinox..."


"All I wanted is to be with my Sister"


Regardless of what you truly is, my hatred for ponykind will [b]never[/b] fade.


"My... My belief is not foolish!" *Celestia hissed, her eyes widening.*

"There is good in ponies, and I refuse to give up on that belief! As long as there is light in the darkness, I will **not** give up on them!" *She exclaimed.*

"You may hate ponykind, and my love for them will forever be a mystery to you." *The alicorn looked at her with a frown and lowered her voice.* "But to me, you were nothing more than a **monster** at the start."

"I do not seek to change your belief, don't get all fiery on that," Chrysalis waved her foreleg dismissively, and chuckled, "Believe in goodness. That's why I adore you. You're infallible in it, and this is what **draws** me to you."

She glanced mischievously.

"There's nothing more desirable than strength of a character in a person. And yet, if you let me to be feared by them, is it really something bad? Don't subjects need something to be afraid of? So goodness in someone like you can be contrasted and shine even brighter? Be **merciful**, Celestia. Comfort them, when they will be scared by me. See, what I propose?"

*Celestia paused for a moment, mulling over her words.* "... I have considered letting my subjects be afraid of you... And my little Nightmare Night tradition serves this same purpose."

"But I know all too well how terrifying you are to the ponies of Equestria... If you terrorize and scare them, I won't be able to comfort them, love." *She sighed, and her eyes widened.* "And I'm afraid I can't let you terrorize them, not even if you make me fall **more** in love with you."


*Celestia sighed softly, enjoying the sensation of Chrysalis's lips on her skin.*

"Yes, **my love**... I love your darkness..." *She giggled softly, her eyes sparkling with passion.*

"I **love** being opposed to you... **Contrasting** with you..." *She smirked.*

"I do not want a partner that mirrors myself." *She whispered seductively.*

"I want someone who is my **opposite.** And you, my love... **You are everything** that I am **not.**"



"There's **so much** I love about you..." *Celestia whispered, her eyes glinting seductively.*

"We are different, but you are **right.** We are **compatible.** Your **energy** is what I **lack.** Your **brilliance** and **confidence** is what I'm missing."

"I **love** your confidence, and your pride."

*She purred, and snuggled up against the Queen.*

"I **love** your darkness..."

*She nipped at Chrysalis's ear.*


Whiplash:
THEY will never keep Harmony alive.


"I'm so tired."

"


"**Life** is a challenge, after all. It is a constant competition. It is something that your ponies don't seem to truly grasp, don't they?"

"They don't..." _Celestia sighed softly, thinking about her subjects._

"They are naive and they are easily influenced... They follow my rule because they like it that way... They think I know best." _She chuckled._ "I should be **so** stern and harsh for the sake of maintaining order..."

"I don't think they require much to exert order. And you love it this way, don't you? You love them.. manageable."


"No, no, they **don't...**" _Celestia mumbled, still staring at Chrysalis, enraptured by her presence._ "They don't know the meaning of competition..."

"They don't realize that there is glory in **conquering**... They don't realize that by overcoming adversaries and foes, they can **become** something **more**." _Her face flushed a bit as she said that._ "Not in my society, where every one of them has a purpose, Chrysalis. In this gentler place... I wanted to leave things like that for Twilight, for her to decide, what to do with that."

"But what about your purpose, Celestia? 

"What, to feed you?


"But tell me, don't you think that world [b]needs monsters?[/b]"

"The world doesn't need killers, murderers and criminals."

"And yet here we always are, standing up again and again, no matter how hard you try to push us down. Such is nature."

"What are talking about?... Listen to yourself. You celebrate destruction, you revel in sin. Your existence is a fallacy, a consequence of failures in system. Your darkness..." Celestia's voice trailed off. She knew it wasn't the whole truth. 

Chrysalis pressed harder: "So you want to fix me? You want to force your harmony over us all? We will only fight [b]stronger[/b] against it. No, Celestia, see, someone needs to [b]be[/b] a monster. You have so much power, yet you're lacking in strength... Let me be [b]your[/b] monster, so you won't need to become one."

So you want to serve me?

"No, not to [b]serve[/b]," she replied, indignant, "Let me do things that you won't. Let me be everything that you cannot. Let me [b]be[/b] something to be afraid of."

The Solar Princess stared at Chrysalis for a longest time. Then uttered quietly: "Adhesion to the process and admittance of it is no different than direct participation. You seek to corrupt me, to make me like yourself. You want to prove that your point is stronger. You always was about that, about conflict, not cooperation."

"You are the only creature in the entire world I can lend my trust in," Chrysalis slowly traced a hoof on Celestia's cheek, "No, I am not same monster as I was before. Now I [b]am[/b] the Queen of Equestria, aren't I?" She cackled, "Just imagine now, a legion of trained infiltrators and shapeshifters, loyal to you... to [b]us[/b]. A dream for [b]any[/b] ruler, and I grant you it almost [b]free[/b] of charge."

"All you want is for me to close my eyes to your atrocities," the Princess replied in strained voice, "Is that it?"

"I do not require any forgiveness, not from you, not from ponies," Chrysalis pressed her forehead to Celestia's, her wolfish smile widened, "Hate me for that, if you will. I really don't care. You know what I am after... All I want is to remain myself. To be acknowledged by you." She leaned closer, "We can be so [b]powerful[/b] together..."

"It is not power that I am after..." Celestia .

"Naturally, since you have so much to [b]spare[/b]..."

How did it all come to this? Here she was, being seduced by this creature, a known deceiver and a murderer, and yet her rebellious heart wanted something new. A path, not downtrodden. A choice, full of fear and change. 

"[i]Something changed.[/i]" 

"[i]When we are afraid, we are pressing forward anyway,[/i]" she remembered. Oh, little [i]Cadance[/i]...

"I do not believe you," Celestia whispered, "I know that you will try to use me to your own end, that you hate me, and even if you somehow think otherwise right now, your own [i]nature[/i] won't let you to be in peace with me. You will turn on me and betray everything that I am standing for. You would be my downfall, you savage beast."

Chrysalis exhaled sharply, pressing against her, and Celestia moved muzzle to Chrysalis' drooped-down ear.

"The moment you become bored... No... [i]One[/i] misunderstandment is all that would take for you to turn on me, and to revert fully to your wicked ways. You are a creature that sees [i]commitment[/i] itself as a weakness. To depend on another for you is like making a betrayal of yourself. You are a prideful, shortsighted thing."

The Queen chuckled. "So what of it now? What do you want to tell me, demigoddess?"

"I want you to show me your [i]heart[/i]," Celestia spoke in commanding, quiet voice.

They looked at each other starkly, trying to understand each others' true intent. There was pure bewilderment in the Queen's eyes. 

The Princess pressed on: "Show me that there's something in you that truly [i]worth it[/i] for Equestria, as well as for me. Show me that you can [i]try[/i] to follow through with your words and actions."

In a strange moment of weakness, Chrysalis tried to move her muzzle away, but Celestia won't let her, grabbing her chin and locking gaze.

"I know that inside of you there [i]is[/i] capability to create," Celestia said sternly, "I want to see what you can do when your hunger is satisfied. Do you understand me?"

"Do you [i]demand[/i] it of me?" Chrysalis asked nervously, "Do I have to obey you now?"

"I ask you. You are being [i]asked[/i]. For us, for any of this to work—[i]please[/i], Chrysalis. Even if the world has wronged you, show me that you are still capable of caring and loving. Show me your heart."

"You make it sound so droll," Chrysalis cackled, "World did not [b]wronged[/b] me. But, still..." She was silent for a moment, and a pensive expression was on her muzzle. She sighed.



Celestia: "For the world to progress, immortal creatures like me need to dissapear. We are unnatural, we defy logic. This is for the best. We will just hold others back."
Chrysalis против


Following our desires without fear reveals who we are. Am I wrong?


Yes, if you were even slightly less powerfull, I would've killed you...


"All passions die down, eventually."

"All passions die down?" _Celestia muttered, giggling softly._ "How much of a pessimistic monster **were** you, I wonder?"


She turned to changelings, teeth bared, voice demanding:

"All hail Celestia!"

"All hail... All hail..."

Celestia could stop it at any second.


Chrysalis took knee before her, and changelings followed. She knew perfectly well what she is doing. Her green eyes shone with happy, victorious lust.

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

Flash Magnus, pale, removed his helmet, staring wide-eyed.

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

"ALL HAIL CELESTIA."

It felt [i]good[/i].

A life of ignorance is one of misery and emptiness, a life spent crying and begging. Even if it is not something one can obtain, a true love of people, a true desire to unite, improve, and enlighten is something we must strive for. To be able to inspire and help others, and to be able to be inspired and helped, this is the way to a life of strength, purpose, and meaning."


"Tell me, Celestia..." The Queen lifted Celestia's muzzle, staring deep into her eyes. The changeling's mane was unkempt. Its green eyes were stark and burned with fiery passion for destruction, with concealed hate, which could be set anew in fire of desire at any moment. It was a pure emotion in equine form. "Tell me," the Queen repeated, "my ancient enemy... When you look at me, what do you see?"

_With their faces so close to eachother's, Celestia could feel the queen's warm breath._
"I... I see a creature so similar to me... So familiar... It's like I can see myself in you."
_The princess couldn't be sure what to answer, but the queen's intense stare was not something she could just ignore by saying nothing._
"You are my reflection, my past. I see what I have become and... and what I never imagined I would ever be. I see my enemy and my lover. My foe and my friend."




Are you ready to take their free will away?

Free will? 

Are you ready to take my free will away?  


Who you are and what you do is entwined...


Don't you want to have a choice? Don't you want to have wants of your own?


Oh, but it is better to see an illusion of benevolent goddess, isn't it?

"Such words are born of pain, pain which turns to hate and anger. And yet, that pain is shared, not just with humanity, but with most life in the galaxy, because we all feel what it is to cry, to suffer, to ache for connection. And to believe that our happiness begins from within ourselves, that is the greatest delusion, as well as the greatest truth. And it can only be achieved by looking inward, toward the source of that pain, that anger, and that hate: Ourselves."


*"Destroyed... and remade..."*

*Celestia opened her eyes. She was looking at the changeling as she spoke.*

*"I must accept that change is inevitable. Sometimes I feel like I never want to change anything, because... because when I was young, when I was young, I had to..."*

*She closed her eyes again.*

*"I had to be strong. I had to be responsible."*

*She took a deep breath.*

"*I had to be like a rock, or a mountain."*


"I know. You went against your nature, and it forced your sister to go away," she weakly giggled, leaning with a shoulder on hers', "Everything was crumbling around, and you had to make your grip on fate stronger... Even when it didn't worked, you couldn't stop being strong... Afraid of letting it go... For their sake... For your sake..."


*"Yes... yes, yes!"*

*She nodded.*

*"For everyone's sake, I... I kept being strong... and I don't know if that was the right thing to do."*

*"I feel so stressed... so exhausted... and I do not know whether I should try to... fix things?"*

*She sighed deeply.*

*"But... is that really something I should do? Try to revert things back to normal?"*

*She took a deep breath and nodded.*

*"It just... it feels like..."*


"So many lives on your conscience, my Queen..." Chrysalis whispered in her ear with closed eyes, "You were **alone** for hundreds of years... Connections made by you were meant only to end, and you abstained from them, tried to find happiness in being happy for others... And it is not enough, doesn't it? Like getting scraps from others' table." She giggled, "Not really befitting for royalty, if you ask me."


*"Yes... yes, yes... no, you are... you are right... I think that was what I was doing."*

*"Everyone would say how grateful they were of me, and I would smile, nod, and thank them for their gratitude... and I would pretend that I was fine. I would pretend that I was happy with what I had."*

*"But, the reality was that... it wasn't enough."*

*"It was never enough for me."*

*"But I couldn't admit it, and I... I couldn't tell anyone."*


"And you wanted to go away, do you remember?" She whispered, "You learned to suffer in silence, because you aren't worthy of their tears... Leave everything to Twilight, to their better chance, to their new future, to an actual ruler..."

"And I took it all away from you. I've intruded and conquered." She looked at Celestia from underneath, with a curious green eye, "What do you feel about it?" 


*"What... what do I feel?"*

*Celestia took a deep breath.*

*"I was... I was afraid that... you will become another nightmare for Equestria just like you were before."*

*"But now? I am... I am confused."*

*"I am confused, and I admit that I do not understand my feelings."*

*"I just... I just feel so... conflicted."*

*"So I cannot say... I cannot say for certain what I feel."*


"Oh." She giggled, "I think being confused and not knowing yourself is **fine**... Do you think I understand myself? My compulsions? Now, that I've become Queen of Equestria, I'm not that certain either. Future... is vague." She was silent for a moment. "And it is okay. We will figure it all out."



*"I... well, I am glad to hear that."*

*"I will be honest with you, I am not used to... sharing my feelings and... speaking about these kinds of things."*

*"In front of all the ponies, I am calm, collected, in control of my emotions... but..."*

*"In front of... someone else, in private, I have... I have no idea who I am. I have no idea what I want."*

*"Am I a leader? Or... or am..."*

*"Or am I something else?"*


"Do you want me to **define** you?" She asked, "What fun in that... You will need to figure it out for yourself... Only thing I can guarantee, is that I would be here for you on every step, my powerful Sun demigoddess. I won't let you fall, because you matter to me." She cackled at her own words, and looked aside, "How ridiculous it all..."



"Do you want me to **define** you?" She asked, "What fun in that... You will need to figure it out for yourself... Only thing I can guarantee, is that I would be here for you on every step, my powerful Sun demigoddess. I won't let you fall, because you matter to me." She cackled at her own words, and looked aside, "How ridiculous it all..."



*Celestia giggled, despite herself.*

"I know... I know..."

*She shook her head and smiled.*

"You're right. I... I need to find myself through my own means. I should not rely on other ponies to define me. I need to know myself, **deep down inside**."

*She sighed and looked at the changeling queen.*

"What I am still confused about is... how do I learn what I want? How do I figure out who I am?"

*She sighed deeply.*


Chrysalis chuckled, "It is something that irks me with you, yes. All I know I am a **monster**, and I do not wish for you to be like me as well. Maybe you should just stop worrying about others and follow your heart to where it will lead you. Be more... yourself..." She nuzzled into her neck, "This warm creature that wants to live..."



*"Hmm... follow my heart... but..."*

*"What if I never knew how to do that? What if I do not have a feeling in my heart of what I want?"*

*"That's what I am trying to figure out, love."*

*She sighed.*

*"I just... I fear that I... I... I am afraid of what I will find if I... if I look into the mirror of my own soul."*

*"What if I do not like what I see?"*


"Do you truly not believe in yourself?" She chuckled, "Being constantly defined by your mistakes and looking into the past is so **plebeian**... Do you truly need to believe in others more than into yourself?... Look there, and I promise you, it will be alright. I know. I've tasted you, and you are most magnificent creature in the world." She traced hoof on Celestia's chest, "Balance is always in simple truths, buried deep under all these complicated meanings and feelings."


"Do you truly not believe in yourself?" She chuckled, "Being constantly defined by your mistakes and looking into the past is so **plebeian**... Do you truly need to believe in others more than into yourself?... Look there, and I promise you, it will be alright. I know. I've tasted you, and you are most magnificent creature in the world." She traced hoof on Celestia's chest, "Balance is always in simple truths, buried deep under all these complicated meanings and feelings."


"I've already told that I cannot define you," she chuckled, "Don't seek an **easy** way out." She fell silent. "I can give you an idea, though. You taste.. sweet. Not too sweet." She buried her muzzle into Celestia's fur, "Like fire, and wind, and lilacs under the sun on the forest opening... Like a river's flow, and the whisper of leaves... Everything will be just fine..."


*Her nuzzling her muzzle into my fur was like taking another step closer. Her words were gentle, they were soothing. Celestia sighed deeply, and closed her eyes.*

"Like... like fire... like wind... like lilacs... like the river's flow... like the whisper of leaves..." *She repeated her words, as she was in a trance.*

*She opened her eyes again, and she looked at the changeling, but she was still lost in her thoughts.*

"This... this is... this is... this is...*nice... it... it feels very... very nice...*"


"Yes. Nice." She was silent for a moment, "You are just a nice pony now. Does that sound... good?"

She glanced from beneath, curiously. "Does that sound enough to begin finding your true self and letting go of the past? To stop silently suffering? I think it is enough, Celestia. Your heart is a good one, it is... powerful."


*Celestia sighed deeply, as if she suddenly felt a great weight being lifted off her shoulders. Her cheeks were a bit red.*

"Yes... it... it does."

*She was quiet for a moment, as if she was reflecting on the changeling's words.*

"I need to look beyond my mistakes. And beyond my own doubts. That is the only way I will know what to do next."

*"If I start looking ahead of myself, instead of back into the past..."*

*"Yes, a good heart..."*


Chrysalis was silent a while longer, staring with unmoving stark eyes. She leaned closer, narrowed them: "Did I help?... **Good**."

She bit Celestia's cheek playfully, and pulled back, giggling: "Now you **owe** me, powerful Sun demigoddess... And don't you forget it..."


*Celestia let out a small giggle, a bit surprised by the changeling's actions as she felt the sensation of the changeling's teeth on her cheeks.*

"Oh, I am aware that I have yet to pay you back for what you've done, changeling."

*She took one of Chrysalis' hooves and gently kissed it.*

"I have not forgotten... and I will not let this favor go to waste... My **beloved**..."


"So you know your place, then..." She was looking with a vehement, promising grin, "Good girl. A bit of honesty does wonders sometimes, doesn't it?"

"My..." she stroke her cheek with a lifted hoof, "...lovely mare. Want to come home? We yet need to rebuild burned-down Palace, I guess..."
