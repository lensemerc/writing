A surrogate daughter.


Really.

Celestia: You think that I am not empathetic?


You will do well to learn that 

Про миррор реалм
If your mind makes it real, then what difference does it have?



While the truth can be an objective thing, what people believe in can win out in the end. You would do well to remember that.

You are headstrong, rebellious, and with a bleeding heart to spare, just like her.

Was I all along some training wheels for Twilight Sparkle?

What, you think i know everything? Bah, of course not! Just like them i listen to prophecies, to tethers, to threads of web of fate, and how they ringa-dinga-dingling about the things to come.
