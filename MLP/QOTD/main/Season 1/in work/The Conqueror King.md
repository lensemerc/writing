Arturia, the idealistic King of Chivalry, shares Gilgamesh's belief that a king is not human - but unlike him, that this not because he is superior to them but because he is a different form of existence, an archetype, an ideal to be held in the name of the kingdom even at the cost of a single person's humanity. But that very same belief puts her at odds with Iskander: to Arturia, being an ideal necessarily means not allowing oneself to enjoy life as a person. As the king of Britain, Arturia became an incarnation of her people's belief in such lofty concepts as courage and justice, but she never lived among them. Gilgamesh, as was mentioned above, agrees with Arturia about the king being above his people - but for the opposite reason. Gilgamesh would lead as a god-king. He believes himself to be above his people (or, indeed, any and every people) in the sense that he believed them all inferior to him. He would never deny himself pleasure in the service of a concept and thus shares Iskander's notion that the king should "laugh louder, drink more, and hold grudges longer" than any man. Of course, while Iskander believes this should be the case because the king is meant to inspire his people to dream, Gilgamesh is simply an arrogant sociopath. Finally, there is Iskander himself: he shares Arturia's ideal that the king is not superior to his people - he believes that he should be first among them but a brother nevertheless - but he cannot agree with her that he should give away his humanity for this because his whole philosophy depends on him being "more human than human". In that sense, he agrees with Gilgamesh's path of hedonism but cannot come to agree with his arrogant reasoning (that the king deserves everything, including to stomp and spit all over his kingdom if it amuses him), putting them at odds. The Grail Dialogue may have been doomed to failure - but it was guaranteed to earn its participants' respect for each other and teach them about themselves.

    You ask me of this? Despite the fact that I rise the Sun in your world? What arrogance... "And that is precisely why I would welcome you in our camaraderie, " the King smiled openly, "With us both on one side, surely the last thing to reach would the distant stars! The deepest depths of oceans! The very core of world itself-nothing shan't stay in our glorious path (изменено)

призывает Эскалибур. a girl that was hold by the curse of ideals


Она смеется.
I make the Sun go up in this world, and yet you intent to challenge me!? Truly, your arrogance have no bounds, the Conqueror King.


And ride gloriously into the final fray

"Friendship in comaradery! We all faced the same enemies"

"Why can't we align and conquer all?"

"I can hardly be unfriendly to you. After all, you might be the last person I will ever see"


"As a king it is my duty to inspire others"

"My men! Our hearts will dance tonight!"


I kinda confused about Rider's analysis about Saber. What's exactly wrong about serving the people since most leaders nowadays have a duty to serve the people?

- I think it's something long the lines of, "serve the people, but also serve yourself" — as a king and a legend, you're not an ordinary politician but an exemplar of humanity, and that means also having human desires. Arturia gave up so much to become the perfect king without enjoying any of the perks of being king, and the country fell to pieces anyway (taking with it her son, her best friends, and her wife) in part because Arthur was so "perfect" people thought he was inhuman. To Iskander, who people loved so much he essentially still commands them in death, that's a pretty big problem.

I will respond to provocation with death (переписать цитату)

You are just a little girl! You were never meant to rule

So how will this conquering commence? 


"You're acting like an ideal. Not like a person."


We can come to some equitable agreement, Conqueror King.

Glory waits beyond the horizon, with the flight of the griffin wings (сверить с реальным македонским)

Truly conquer, to conquer one's soul


"The griffin kingdom where our valiant friends for a hundreds of years, and yet their nature..." 

She looked as they were readying to fight for their lives.

"Their nature is lacking."
