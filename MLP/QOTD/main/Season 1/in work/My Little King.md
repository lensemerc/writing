a changeling seeks to rebel against own nature


You got yourself a succulent partner.

Yes, she was right. He knew those ponies no more that a few days... a few weeks. While he knew her all his life.

Only way it could go.

She 

Only way it can go.

    Emerald... He wanted to sing her name, and so he did. It was such a delicious name.

    He wondered how would having a family taste like? 

A delicious name for a delicious mare. A unique, perfect name.

He wanted to scream her name from every mountain.

He loved a freckle over corner of her mouth, and loved her smile. She saved him.


"You want... you want to lose yourself in this..." _she moaned quietly, while her tail was playfully flicking against Chrysalis._

"Lose **everything”... and feel... and feel **nothing** but..." _she whispered._ "But pleasure..."


Arched his back from pleasure.


There is no other way.

You're always quick to point out how much we don't fit in with the ponies, and yet the changelings at the hive have never seen things more clearly! Even back when you were our ruler everyone in the hive hated you! I might not be as ruthless as you, and yes, maybe my hive does look up to me, but even without all of that they choose to have me as their ruler instead of you! I am no usurper, I am a changeling. I've just found my own way of doing things, one that actually works and doesn't drive everyone insane!


W-wait! Please! Ponies might be wary or suspicious towards us, but most of them don't have a problem with us anymore! They know our intentions are truly good! They see that I've been a good ruler for my hive and that I care deeply for each and every changeling! I'm not trying to make some master race, I'm just trying to care about everyone and have them all be my friends! You can't be this stubborn all the time! Let us change! Let us evolve! Let us be good!

No... No, you can't do this! I've seen the light beyond you. *The changeling queen is about to make good on her threat, draining Thorax in the way the old changelings used to, to get stronger. But... something within Thorax remains defiant. A love for his subjects, his changelings. And the trust that they've put into him, and that they want him to be their changeling king. He won't let his past define him, not now, not now that he's finally begun changing for good.*

"You will always be a creature of the darkness... A creature of **me**." She growls, moving faster and faster, claiming him, taking him, "No one ever can change their **nature**... A sweet lie... You are no pony... You are a beast that hunts..." She cackles, "An **insect**, yes-s-s... My loyal soldier..."


I... I... *He is completely frozen against his will and yet his body remains moving in the same rhythm as her. The love is all fading away as she sucks him dry and he can feel his mind being invaded and corrupted, as if it is no longer his anymore. He sees that look in Chrysalis' eyes, her pure hatred and satisfaction at her victory. For her, it's not about his love anymore, but about victory, about showing a changeling's true nature.*

*He gasps for air, unable to say a word. She's right... he is just like her, isn't he? He's been nothing more than a predator, surviving but never truly living, until he met his hive. But is there a way to get free? Is he completely lost? He tries to focus on pushing her out, but with the rush of emotions and pleasure being fed into him it's hard... to... resist... Is she really right? Will he go back to this hollow life? No... No! He'll resist! He has to!*


"You love me, my Thorax. You know it. In your heart, you **love** me, because you can not to. You believed that I will change... But the truth is... My love for you is far stronger than yours. Is is a devouring, wicked thing, that can engulf the whole world. 

I love you, my changelings, far more. And my love is a devouring, wicked thing, that can engulf the whole world. Who are you to deny me this? Who are you to deny me what's [b]mine?[/b]


that can burn the whole world." She licks his neck, as her hoof in fast motion finishes him off. The secretion drips down on the floor.  "Ah-h, rewarding, is it not?... 

"Don't you understand that this **is** the better future for our race?" *You look Pharynx squarely in the eyes.* "The changelings belong above the other races, they always have, they always will. That is a matter not of opinion or desire, but fact. You cannot deny that." *You look at the changelings with all the confidence of Queen Chrysalis.* "I am not corrupted, I am enlightened! I am fulfilling my purpose as a changeling. My entire existence is dedicated to the glory of my Queen and my race. This is what it means to be a changeling!"
