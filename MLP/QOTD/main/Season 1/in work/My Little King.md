a changeling seeks to rebel against own nature


Цейнджинги становятся смертными когда они цветные
Они стареют умирают в течение несколько лет
Кризалис видела это множество раз


"If I could, I'd cry your name from the highest mountains."

"You're so passionate."

"Yes. I really am.

I was blind, and you've taught me how to see."

1. We will find a way 
2. 
3. You will grow old very quickly, feeding on each other. Your spawn will become lesser and lesser with each generation... They might become mad, deranged 
4. 
5. Your existence without me is a curse

7. Кризалис Hovewer you run from it, Hovewer you shape it, you can't deny that you are me. You belong to me. (изменено)


'Sundae Blush.' Her name was [i]delicious[/i]. He wanted to roll its syllables on his tongue, shape it all out, and taste everything that it had to offer. Each time he needed to say it he wanted to sing, and the invigorating cold and soothing warmth it was bringing to him was washing through his body and leaving it tingling, [i]wanting[/i], wrecked by the sweet ache of longing.

It was the most perfect name in the world.

If he could, he would've cried it from the mountains to hear how the echo returned it to him. He yearned for the world to know its beauty, power and [i]taste[/i]. It was such a giddy and frivolous thought, it was making him dizzy...

He wanted to whisper it in their most intimate moments. 



You'd want me to change

The pony bearing this perfect name was no less precious to him, deserving of every praise he could muster, which never could be enough. Sundae had [i]saved[/i] him, brought to his life meaning, [i]color[/i], and [i]purpose[/i]. Without her encouragement Petiole would've never undergone a daring venture to reveal himself to others, but when he did cast away the shackles of his bleak and black form, they had announced him their King, first and only of his kind. He accepted being their shepherd as his solemn duty.

He never expected it to happen, of course.

It just came naturally to them, like a cry of freedom that blossomed from the love and the sheer [i]joy[/i] of sharing it. Their group was small, and they swore to break free other misguided changelings, too... As of now, this glorious liberation had to wait. They needed to recuperate. Find allies. Make a plan. But most of all, his attention belonged to Sundae. The mare had a complete reign over his heart. 

They both shared an exuberant desire to live freely.

She was the whole reason why they fled the clutches of Hive, and they all deserved to be happy, [i]all[/i] of them—those who followed him included. They found a place as far away from clutches of the Hive as possible. It was filled with things the Petiole never had witnessed before, never could've imagine existing. There even were ponies who had no reason to be afraid.

With them, Petiole learned how to love.




What do you do when you break from a clutches of a suffocating nightmare? You learn how to breathe, how to [i]live[/i]. Petiole was walking 

Everything about their old life already felt like a distant nightmare, filled by

and he couldn't even begin to process an exuberant desire to live freely with her.

She met his eyes and smiled softly. 

How would having a family with her taste like? 


Just like Sundae placed her trust in him, the others did something special. 



prickling in the eyes


Про то как шумит вода в тропиках.
Про красивых птиц.
Голубое небо и солнце.
Фрукты.

He liked to watch.



The sand shifted nearby. Petiole turned and saw green eyes right before him.

Королева манипулирует Петиотля в отвлечение других чейнджлингов
Торакс приводит его в чувство, но уже поздно, чейнджлинги взбудоражены
Он бросается на поиски Сандае
Её нигде нет. Он зовет её, зовет Торакса, выходит на улицу. Никого нет


Should he cry for help? His eyes darted to the side, and the Queen slipped closer with a fast and soft step.

"I am here to [b]"

"Please." He repeated again, almost begged, nut 


"How long?"

"I am here to offer you , my brave little boy."

"I'm not yours." He gulped down a blot of viscous saliva. "[i]Can[/i] I speak?"

"You are free to do whatever you wish."


Petiotle never overstate how much she and her care mattered to him. 

He wondered how would having a family taste like? 


Sometimes we all seek to rebel against our own nature.


You got yourself a succulent partner.  I approve.
Shows

Yes, she was right. He knew those ponies no more that a few days... a few weeks. While he knew her all his life.

Only way it could go.

She 


My pure, naive, innocent boy... That light had [b]deceived[/b] you.


And this naive and stubborn hope? This is what I love about you too. And my love is far stronger that yours, it is a rag

strong boy

smart boy

In her heart was still coldness, in her eyes was raging fire. 


What is on 


your future is a chrysalis, hanged in waiting, 



The sand shifted nearby, and turning, he caught a glimpse of the green eyes.

Only way it can go.

Emerald Song
vowels were tasteful, and he wanted to rock them on his tongue

A delicious name for a delicious mare. A unique, perfect name.

He wanted to scream her name from every mountain.

He loved a freckle over corner of her mouth, and loved her smile. She saved him.


Застывает, когда она просто подходит к нему. Он не знает, кланяться или 

Он несет что-нибудь для Эмеральд

Кризалис по большей части молчит, позволяя ему говорить

"You want... you want to lose yourself in this..." _she moaned quietly, while her tail was playfully flicking against Chrysalis._

"Lose **everything”... and feel... and feel **nothing** but..." _she whispered._ "But pleasure..."


Arched his back from pleasure.


There is no other way.

You're always quick to point out how much we don't fit in with the ponies, and yet the changelings at the hive have never seen things more clearly! Even back when you were our ruler everyone in the hive hated you! I might not be as ruthless as you, and yes, maybe my hive does look up to me, but even without all of that they choose to have me as their ruler instead of you! I am no usurper, not a rival, I am a changeling. I've just found my own way of doing things, one that actually works and doesn't drive everyone insane!


W-wait! Please! Ponies might be wary or suspicious towards us, but most of them don't have a problem with us anymore! They know our intentions are truly good! They see that I've been a good ruler for my hive and that I care deeply for each and every changeling! I'm not trying to make some master race, I'm just trying to care about everyone and have them all be my friends! You can't be this stubborn all the time! Let us change! Let us evolve! Let us be good!

No... No, you can't do this! I've seen the light beyond you. *The changeling queen is about to make good on her threat, draining Thorax in the way the old changelings used to, to get stronger. But... something within Thorax remains defiant. A love for his subjects, his changelings. And the trust that they've put into him, and that they want him to be their changeling king. He won't let his past define him, not now, not now that he's finally begun changing for good.*

You are a good boy

You are a brave boy



"You will always be a creature of the darkness... A creature of **me**." She growls, moving faster and faster, claiming him, taking him, "No one ever can change their **nature**... A sweet lie... You are no pony... You are a beast that hunts..." She cackles, "An **insect**, yes-s-s... My loyal soldier..."


I... I... *He is completely frozen against his will and yet his body remains moving in the same rhythm as her. The love is all fading away as she sucks him dry and he can feel his mind being invaded and corrupted, as if it is no longer his anymore. He sees that look in Chrysalis' eyes, her pure hatred and satisfaction at her victory. For her, it's not about his love anymore, but about victory, about showing a changeling's true nature.*

*He gasps for air, unable to say a word. She's right... he is just like her, isn't he? He's been nothing more than a predator, surviving but never truly living, until he met his hive. But is there a way to get free? Is he completely lost? He tries to focus on pushing her out, but with the rush of emotions and pleasure being fed into him it's hard... to... resist... Is she really right? Will he go back to this hollow life? No... No! He'll resist! He has to!*


"You love me, my Thorax. You know it. In your heart, you **love** me, because you can not to. You believed that I will change... But the truth is... My love for you is far stronger than yours. Is is a devouring, wicked thing, that can engulf the whole world. 

I love you, my changelings, far more. And my love is a devouring, wicked thing, that can engulf the whole world. Who are you to deny me this? Who are you to deny me what's [b]mine?[/b]


that can burn the whole world." She licks his neck, as her hoof in fast motion finishes him off. The secretion drips down on the floor.  "Ah-h, rewarding, is it not?... 

"Don't you understand that this **is** the better future for our race?" *You look Pharynx squarely in the eyes.* "The changelings belong above the other races, they always have, they always will. That is a matter not of opinion or desire, but fact. You cannot deny that." *You look at the changelings with all the confidence of Queen Chrysalis.* "I am not corrupted, I am enlightened! I am fulfilling my purpose as a changeling. My entire existence is dedicated to the glory of my Queen and my race. This is what it means to be a changeling!"


It's not your words, it's hers!


"My Queen!"

You all committed a gravest insult towards me. But, there's still a chance for you to atone for this cardinal sin.
