"The Mare in The Moon... Are you watching?"

Lone figure raised her hooves to the night sky. A mad pained smile was distorting her muzzle.

"Are you looking at me?"

[hr]

[center]Now she
Teeter-tottering,
Tinkering, tampering,
wicked mare with a fiendish glare.
A forlorn recluse, planning devious ruse.

All who lives in Hoovesville heard of her.

How she
Plotting, beguiling, 
Building, devising,
Roaming, nickering,
Thieving and bickering,
that churned and crooked vile hag!
"despicable crone!" "haughty old bat!"
Nopony likes her, and no one calls to play.
All town would breathe easy if she went away.

But she
Lingering, lumbering,
Seething and slandering,
Preying and prying, 
Creepily crawling,
Hacking and hewing away in her shed
Plotting for everyone an odd cruel end

SO

When the Moon rises high, and the Mare casts a glare,
If smart ponies hear her, they remain in a bed,
Or she'd steal them away in her shabby, dark shed.
Just as 
she took 
a lock of the hair,
a page from a diary,
a trinket from shelf,
a small stuffed toy,
a shriveled dark rose,
a rusted lucky horseshoe,
even a slice of raspberry pie! She's like a magpie!
That's what puts in her greasy, torn bag
                              that sleazy old hag!

But one little girl                                                                 
Bright-eyed little girl                                                         
                                     didn't knew what she'd wrought.
Foreign castaway, her kindness she sought.
"What are you, mad?" spoke all in Hoovesville,
"Stay away from the old hag!"
"The hag don't really care (The hag can't really care)"
"It'll be just unwise! (All good she'll despise)"
"Act like we do, stay safe as thus (Don't dramatise...)"
"Your future's with us!                                                            
                                       [sub]and our bittersweet white lies[/sub]"


Clumsily and without any grace
Took her in a heartfelt embrace

"Can you hear-hear?
Hear hear
Hear-hear
How knock-knocking it into your chest?
Like a silken touch
As a gentle nudge
Can you hear how calling out?
the Magic of Love?
to your heart?"[/center]
"NO!"

With all feeble strength she could muster, Prismia brought her wrinkly hooves mercilessly on the little pegasus' head and struck the filly down. And immediately gasped, as a chilling sensation rose in her chest, drowning out last vestiges of doubt about one single and undisputable thing—she *is*, in fact, a *bad* pony. Everything that was ever said about her was true.

But even now, despite being in the mud on the ground, this pathetic little pink thing kept looking at her without judgment. Struggling with sudden regret, Prismia shrinked away, her muzzle contorted in an unsightly grimace. She wanted to scream, to run, to tear her own hair, to throw away the medallion that worked as a conduit, but instead she just stood and shook like a leaf, keeping staring with widened eyes. 

That damnable filly rose up, not caring for the bruise in the slightest. She remained soft-spoken: "I know why you are so sad and alone. I understand it now. You pushed everyone away, right?"

"Y-you! How dare you!? What do you even know!?" Prismia bleated.

"No, I understand it. I really-really am. I don't have anyone else too. I don't know where I came from. That family I'm with, t-they just f-found me in a forest, completely alone," the filly nervously smiled, stepping closer.

"Get away from me! I'm warning you, stand back!" Her horn lighted up, but despite it all, she just couldn't force herself to call magic upon this stubborn, obnoxious child.

The filly not listened. She, itty bitty thing, was forcing her to keep backing away, right where her machine was creaking and cracking on top of the hut, surging with power as it kept leeching love from the denizens of the city. The filly wasn't looking at it, her gaze never left Prismia. She kept talking, quietly, insistently: "They don't need me. The family that took me in have their own children, I have many sisters now, but they all just like it when I am around. They know I'm not like them, and they are afraid. They are afraid of you too because you're not like anyone else, right?"  

"

"It is never too late to open your heart again," she whispered, "It is not your past that keeps it closed, only you."

"*What's with that kid...*" Prismia сlosed his eyes and sucked a deep breath through her teeth. She needed to calm down... 

"You need me much more than anyone else." The filly placed her little hoof on her own. The warm, incredible sensation from the touch oddly reminded Prismia of her mother, made her remember the time when she was a child.

Why did she never had kids of her own? No one ever looked at her like this filly, because she... she decided to... 

Prismia realised that she is slipping. She couldn't stop an avalanche of emotions that was stirring up within her. Was it overabundance of excessive love magic at fault, or the fact that her own senses were sharpened, but her heart panged with the dull old pain nonetheless, of the kind with which old wounds open up, those that never healed proper before.

She remembered vividly how she thought that she was *special*, and how the world decisively had shown her that she never was. All her bitterness, all her plans, projects and research that were never needed, never *required*...

This filly was old enough to be her daughter... No, she realised, as she remembered her own age. She could've been her *grand*daugther just as well... When she became so old and bitter?

Girl smiled and stayed close despite Prismia's unwashed body and rugged clothes, despite the chugging infernal machine, saturated with green energy. She was only one of all these ingrates and imbeciles in the town, who wasn't afraid of her. Her innocent eyes were soul-churning, burning Prismia harsher than any brand, as if drilling itself into her memories.

And she couldn't look away.

"You are just some nameless useless orphan!" She whined on top of her lungs. It was all kinds of disgraceful. 

The girl nodded solemnly, "Yes. And it is alright." She smiled, and Prismia's heart pushed into her throat, "If my purpose to be here and help you, then I don't mind it at all."

"I d-dont need y-you... I don't need..." She was the great enchantress, a sorceress, an artificer, an inventor... How did she let herself become so weak?

"Come, now," the filly hummed gently, "every pony needs a little help, now and again."

It hitted harder than any blow. Her father spoke just like that, with exactly same words. Prismia whinnied, fell onto her knees, clenched her temples with hooves. Long ago, she wanted to make him so proud of her, before the life in Canterlot became too demanding and she ceased speaking to her low-born family... It is all this vile love magic... She lost control over it, there could be no other explanation. Why she feels so *wrong*?

"I'm not worth of anything..." she groaned, as more memories begun submerging from the furthest outreaches of mind. All guilt and pain, mostly self-inflicted, everything that could've been avoided...

"No, no..." the words were spilling out of the filly's mouth like a little waterfall of love, "You are the entire world."

Prismia jerked head up, stared with a bewildered glare. She mustered just enough dignity to not let self-pity take control of her mental faculties, and scrambled up to her hooves. Enough of this.

"I..." she tried to speak, and then shook her head, clenched her teeth. [i]Enough[/i] of this.

[i]Enough of this.[/i]

Like in a daze, she turned in a haze, a rat in a maze filled with wrong choices... Facing the hut, she gripped tightly the woodcutters axe left lying at her hooves, then lunged forward, climbed the small ladder at the side of the building. There was the nexus of the machine, its soul, while most of the ugly body was concealed down below. Years of hard labor went into this thing. Priceless gemstones were laid in the foundation of the project, being hidden away in the houses of ponies to serve as amplifiers of their natural-born love. Dragon scales adorned the device, as well as exact replica of medallion on her chest, exquisite and unique, now heavy as lead... Prismia adored the machine, the culmination of her life's work.

"*What am I doing?*"

Her eyes went over the darkened town, and she noticed for the first time how the trees and grass near the hut became dull grey-brownish color, as if her laputan device was draining something from the air and ground itself. Tears streamed down her muzzle. If it will continue like that, many innocent ponies will just wither away, not even understanding in their ignorance what is happening, until it will be too late. And all because she was experimenting and scrying, trying to decipher what lies behind the emotion, or rather the *power*, of love...

"*What have I done?*"

The filly was still nearby, as she flew on the rooftop after Prismia. The enchantress weighted the axe in her hooves, unsure.

"You have to go. Run off to your family. It isn't safe," she croaked in harsh, abrupt sentences.

"I'm staying," she simply responded.

"You don't get it. I don't know what will happen if I... when I... The extrusion effect, the energy..."

Tiny filly placed a hoof on her own, and again, there was this warm tingling sensation... A hot pie, just baked and fresh from the oven. Father's smile. A sunlight-filled field. A sudden letter, received from dear friend on the other side of the country. Simple words: "I miss you*"... A walk through the park when she was still young, while wearing a beautiful summer dress. Hours on end that she spent with her friends, just fooling and playing around. She remembered so vividly that other life, when the world was filled with fillies like this one, when she herself was just like her, long before she wanted to be feared, and revered, and cherished, swayed by all the visions of grandeur, met by all the burdens and heartbreak...

Prismia smiled painfully. "You won't leave me..."

"Let's do it together," the filly helped her lift the axe.   

"Yes." She could never do it alone.

They brought the axe down right on the heart of the machine, the blade sank deep into the spot where the stored power was most condensed.

--

Tall, angelic, radiant figure with giant wings, each one as dozen little fillies like her... She was like an art come alive, painted in canvas of twinking stars...

Voice called out to her, precious, pure and soothing, flowing like a water of mountain spring: "Congratulations, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza! Great deeds are expected of you."

--

The girl dissapeared, or maybe she never existed at all. It mattered little. Prismia couldn't be stopped.


Prismia hacked until her hooves were on verge of giving out.
Like a wingless angel of death разрушает свою избу

 Prismia was like a beast, destroying all her life's wok
Filly was gone. Was she even real? Prismia wasn't sure. It mattered little.

жители деревни понемногу выходят и смотрят на Призмию

"Look at what you've done to me!" she howled desperately, wishing fervently for it all to be finished already.


"Why do you cry?"

she was stepping slowly, shrugging the ash from her wings one by one.
Выходит из огня разрушающейся избы

"Please-please do not cry..."

She cried even harder from that.

"Don't you dare break my heart," she whimpered, pressing muzzle against multicolored mane of hers.

The alicorn filly giggled tenderly: "I shall not break your heart. I am not a pony who breaks hearts. I am a pony who mend them~..."


[END]


"It isn't my real family. 

I don't know what will happen when I smash it,"

"I-I won't. I know that this village doesn't love me, not really. I'm just pleasant to be around, that is all," she sniffed, "They don't need me. You, right now... You do."

"Will you leave me too?"

"No, I won't. I-I don't have anyone else either. I just woke up in the forest one day..."

Prismia pushed her with all feeble strength, and little filly 

lacerations on hooves

all she accrued

Humming, embittering
knowing no tune 

Spoken hush, with no love at all.
Alone she roams, that crooked vile hag
the despicable crone
the despicable crone

See how under the gaze of the beguiling moon
She creepily creeps and hums with no tune.
Just like she took 
a lock of the hair,
a page from a diary,
a trinket from shelf,
a small stuffed toy.


obtuse - тупой

So her wrinkly pale hooves

she takes what's not hers, to vile odd end





snitches
britches
scratches
touches


Stay far away, keep y

Beguile and whisper



See,
beguiling and loving moon
what I've worked on
what I've done
what I've did!
I had to go places far out of the sight
I've sought for a knowledge 


envious 
little
promiscuous
brittle
will be gone!

SO!



Everyone knows the old bitter hag
Who lives on the 


Embittered, eschewed



Beguiling gaze
The crescent Moon
Little white lie


I was 

Can you shut
up
And read between
lines?

Even if not
(even if not)



The old
crooked hag
she was
nowadays
Gone was
the splendour
wash out

'Prismia', she had been called nowadays. Just 'Prismia'. Long ago she was someone to be feared, and revered, and cherished. Stallions were at their knees at her hooves, her wit and intellect was unparalleled, she was in Canterlot's finest circles... Now, the thing that remained was but a mere shadow of her old self. 

The envy, that's what secured her downfall back then. That what brought her down. Their plotting and scheming, they all wanted to see her in this misery and squalor. 


Dragonscale and some gems


Just some nameless orphan child. You don't even do anything!



"Get away from me!" she raspily demanded, and smashed a hoof on her face

It wasn't genuine
All of it wasn't genuine
It will never be genuine 

"It is never too late to open your heart again," she whispered, "It is not your past that keeps it closed, only you."

"What do you even know..."

It is making pies for all to enjoy... It is reading a book on a hot summer day... It is everything, and I think you deserve it

--

An apparition, magnificent and angelic, standing taller that any pony she ever saw before

"Congratulations, Princess Mi Amore Cadenza..." she said in a gentle and beautiful voice, sending goosebumps of joy down filly's spine, filling her with sensation of *purpose*, "Now. Rise."
