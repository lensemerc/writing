Once upon a time, there were two sisters. We will call them Celly and Selly. Their real names were sounding other than that.

Their lives were to revolve around the [color=#DC143C]fire[/color].

While the one was circling above, the other was to mirror from down below. That way they would cover it from all sides.

The [color=#DC143C]fire[/color] was not everything to them, as they were allowed to turn away and even wander, as long as the other one was there to guard it. They took their duty to the [color=#DC143C]fire[/color] seriously.

One time, Selly turned and noticed something in the distance. She saw mortals. She shared her findings with Celly.

"They are little and insignificant. Do not pay them attention and stay away," said Celly.

Selly wanted to do good by her sister, but she was also curious to see more of the mortals.

She wasn't going to intrude. She was only peeking with one little eye of hers. Still, the mortals had caught its silvery gleam, and they became inspired by it.

Selly liked their admiration.

She felt like it needed to be rewarded and stimulated. She waited until Celly was turned away, and she had brought them the [color=#DC143C]fire[/color], curious to see what they would do.

What she saw made her feel great many feelings, and also it made her more happy than ever before.

When she returned to share the findings, Celly was furious.

"Dream-sister," said Celly, "you have deceived me."

"I expected that you would understand," said Selly.

"It is unacceptable. You have broken my trust," said Celly.

"They were alone and cold, just like you were before I came into existence. I took pity on them," said Selly.

Celly did not wanted to hear more excuses. In a great anguish and hurt from betrayal, she eclipsed her sister with rage.

Competition between siblings is a tale older than sin.

In another fable, they might've became rivals after this. 

But creatures like them so often do not know how to measure their strength... 

In this fable, when Celly's rage subsided, she had found Selly dimmed and still.

"Sister. Sister? Wake up. I did not mean to. Please wake up," said Celly.

She called her again and again. She tried to pick her up. She tried to do [i]anything[/i].

She started to panic.

She cried so much that her tears had formed into new seas.

"I think that she is broken. I have to fix her," said Celly.

Celly did not know death, so she assumed that Selly should not know it either. Otherwise, the world would be full of wrong.

And so she took her to the winds, and to the mountains, and to the streams, and to the dark undersides of the world, and to its cold heights.

And so she took her to the spirits elder and lesser, and to the monkey-faced deities, and the elephant-faced deities, and the lizard-faced deities, and the feline-faced deities, and the canine-faced deities, and the other-faced deities, too.

And so she took her to the realms of the dreams and the realms of the stars, everywhere except the realms of the dead. She searched and searched, humbled, forced to begging for help.

In the vast above and beyond, in its breadth and length, and in the depth of the whole world, no one could offer her succor. But there was the one who could offer insight.

"She is still alive. Her embers of life had gone cold, but she is still here," he said. He was very old, and the light of his sight was granted to him by the eldest stars. We will call him Willy. He had great many limbs.

"I will take the [color=#DC143C]fire[/color] back from the mortals. I will use it to save her," said Celly.

"You would undo what she had done? She won't be happy with you. The tragedy would repeat," said Willy. He was very wise.

"It is their fault! They must suffer! They had corrupted my dream-sister with their crude songs, and games, and plays, and [i]imagination[/i], and [i]wants[/i], and [i]mortality[/i]," said Celly.

"They had experienced the [color=#DC143C]fire[/color] and now they will be deprived of it. They will now suffer more than ever. The cold and longing would gnaw at them stronger tenfold. It is inevitable," said Willy.

"Then, I would devise a trick for how to keep [i]everyone[/i] happy and warm," said Celly. "For I will become a fire myself."

And she had plucked a quill from one of her wings. She used it as the [b]white-hot[/b] needle.

And with it, she had sewn the [color=#DC143C]fire[/color] deep into Selly's scorched heart.

And from that day forth both sisters lived like they had been born anew.

And it all was a lie. Dreams often are.
