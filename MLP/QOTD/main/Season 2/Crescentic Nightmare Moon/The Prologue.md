She drifted in the cozy blackless void among the stars. Everywhere her eyes reached, there was an expressively spilled palette of soothing colors

"Is this you? The Dream Princess?"

Ginger's favorite doll was in her likeness.

There were so many little fillies like her, after all, and there was only one Luna for all of them. But—[i]oh[/i]... she was a [i]sight[/i] to behold. Ginger smiled through her tears.

"Is this really you?" she asked, just to be sure. She would've asked a hundred times more if she could.

"I am Ginger Lime."

"Are you cold, little Lime?"

Ice-filled, teal watchful eyes

"You're [i]shivering[/i], little one. What ails you? Is it sickness?"

"What is on your mind?"

"It's not that, it's"

At some point, Dad began to carry her on his back, and the steady rocking movement almost lulled her to sleep. He was warm. She took in the smell of his mane. She felt [b]safe[/b].

"I can bring Tiberius if you want.

"I want to help you. Please, do go on."

"There was something very wrong in the woods,"

"Wrong, you say?"

The cracking of branches, the rustle of leaves.

Луна показывает деревню. Is this your home?

Branches, collapsing. The shadow, overtaking.

"There was someone very tall,"

Luna saw the glimpse

Little Lime was so small.

Lime shook her head wordlessly.

Fear not, sweet child. I'll find you and see to it that no harm will come to you.

You promise?

Verily so. You are under mine watch, now.

Now drift yourself to sleep and don't you worry. Let me take care of everything.

The girl hadn't said anything about this.

Shan't we summon your friends from the overworld, your Majesty?

'Tis an opportunity for night ponies to prove themselves. Besides, we have no right to surrender the night to any other, it belongs to us."

I've been talking about this with your elders, and they were in agreement with my views. We are the creatures of the night, the messengers of cold light of her Moon.

"Ai, they both are merely fledglings. I can work with that, still."

Is that what you want to do, night children? To stay put whilst innocence suffer?

Luna spoke with indignation.

We are not meant to engage.

It is troubles of the surface dwellers, not ours.

I am not a warrior too, and so what? Does my want to protect others somehow makes me lesser?

Her nightkin glanced at each other with growing uncertainty. They were tall, imposing, with leathery wings and grins full of sharp fangs, but under all this fierce exterior they were identical to any other lost children. Luna smiled ruefully.

"The Moon will watch over us," she prompted. "'Tis time for you to exculpate Her love—and mine as well."

"We live to serve, Night Mother," Onyx replied, bowing along with his companion.

Luna hemmed and turned away. "Let us make haste."

It is decided: I am mantling the rescue operation.

The elders would not mind.

Luna responded with brief irritation.

I am the judge of mine own decisions.

Fret not, my dearest children.

'Tis thine choice alone. Thy can stay if that is your desire.

You can take those talks to Sister of mine.

"Dawnstar preaches peace!?" hissed Sable to her compatriot.

"The Daybreaker..." Onyx hung his head in reverent terror.

Luna made an effort to not roll her eyes. "In my presence call her [i]Princess[/i] Celestia. She is mine dearest Sister, no more and no less than that."

Sometimes bloodshed is necessary.

It was the worst feel -- of being trapped, powerless to do anything about it.

The urge to sob irresistibly rushed to her nostrils, and she pushed it down through an enormous effort.

You won't prevail.

Thou art on a path that is leading to nothing but your own destruction. You will lose, witch.

Wake up the girl. I want them all suffer.

Princess? What should we do?

Princess?

Luna's ears were ringing.

She watched how cocoon with little Lime was prodded by changelings. The girl sleepily opened her eyes, waking into a pure nightmare.

Alas,

It also does a good job of showing Luna off in a more… I want to say motherly aspect but that isn't quite right. Luna often gets stereotyped as the Princess of War. The dour one, with fell countenance and fury, while Celestia gets to serve the aspect of the counselor and kind parent. It's good to see Luna getting into that, particularly because 'cares for foals' really does mesh well with her proper canon role.

They all are here, near her--all but a dream away.

Not the first time I see you, Princess...
