An eternity in the cold dark. A distant surface above.

𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚊𝚢 𝚕𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 shone defiant; the 𝚏𝚛𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎𝚜 were glistening on ripples.

Her dark wings dragged her to the depths.

The rays of moonlight pierced the calm around her.

The stillness... The desire to give in... She wanted to become one with the dark. She let it in. Treacherous cold burned her insides and her fear surged; her body twisted in pain. She clutched herself and curled up, 𝚛𝚎𝚐𝚛𝚎𝚝𝚝𝚒𝚗𝚐.


"..."


The animal was grotesque. Something bright kept falling from its obscenely long tongue, thrown over the fangs. When that something was reaching the tip of the tongue, it was colored in red.

A being with a motherly face helped to tuck her in. It embraced her and pulled close. It lifted her head and rested against exposed soft breast, and whispered just above her ear, "When the fighting die down and the quiet darkness comes, the bloodied Moon will shine like a bright red Sun. Don't be deceived by its sight: it is a demand for a drastic change. It means that we have defiled our paradise—the very lands that surround us.

Their mouths were stitched.

We must go.

You have no choice. We have to go.


"We must. Hold her legs!"

She is not the first, and she won't be the last.

Её крики превращаются в нечленораздельные вопли


The water, viscous like tar. She couldn't get away.

I go where I please.


"You again."

"Pretender. [i]You[/i]."

"Me," Chrysalis mocked, mirroring her stance.

"Insect. You belong in the dirt."

"You want more?"


"[b]Chase[/b] me."

She fell just like her.

It brought her 𝚓𝚘𝚢.


Thieves! Liars! Traitors!

Traitors are everywhere.

Trying to shield himself from her wrath, Onyx Star fell
Тащит sack
The thread on his mouth was cut, but it still hanged from the flesh of his lips.
How can I betray someone who I never truly loved?


Her sister was staring from 

"[spoiler]]████[/spoiler] [spoiler]████████[/spoiler]." Her soot-lips moved into a cruel smile. "The absence of agency can be likened to salvation, therefore, why worry about things that are outside of your influence?"

Why are you here, to spell more profane wisdoms? 

"Oh." "I am sorry. Am I being a bother?"
"I can come later if you'd like..."

Luna couldn't hold back her disdain. "'Twas always fascinating to me how you were a closest thing I had to a mother."

"I am glad you were having fun with me," riposted Celestia, putting up her smile like a front. Her concerned eyes studied Luna's expression, and she added ruefully, "But it's quite alright, since you are not the only one who views me like that. It's not like we get to choose such things, either."

"No. We do not," generously acknowledged Luna despite a pang of jealousy.  Their relationship was supposed to be a [i]special[/i] one.



Not again.
Is this... me?...


Why fall if you can fly?


I can't. I can't. 
I can't. My wings don't listen to me!





Innocence is [i]not[/i] foolishness! she heard her own voice, loud and proud, burning with righteousness. To wholly believe that everyone has good in them is [i]not[/i] wrong!

"[i]But it does not change anything for the better. It only makes everything worse,[/i]" an ugly, unbecoming thought came to her. 


Think you deserve a family? Why?

Why are you even here?

Who do you think you are?

...[i]the skin[/i].

"What is on your mind?"

Inertia of our movement has led us here at the starting point.
This momentum, this [i]impulse[/i], is everything. 
You were in a freefall for all of your life.

Do you think you deserve to have wings?

See through the eye of a needle. See the storm, raging.

What is better, to notice your change or to remain oblivious to it?

Hatred is a [i]hard[/i] work.

"That's right."

The shadows will swallow us whole


You think that there are anything -- any [i]thing[/i] that can end your pain?

The barrage of voices was becoming bothersome. 

I won't be intimidated.
We are the masters of our own fate, or are we not?


The cold running through her veins, through her sinews, orifices, eyes.
Тени настигают покровом. and whipped her forehooves around Luna's neck Шепот ребенка:
When will the winter come?

Luna tried to gasp but there was no air, there was nothing. "Lime..." she squeezed through sheer force of will, but then couldn't bring herself to say another word except for: "Why?"

"You were given a verdict without a proper trial."

"Like it [i]always[/i] worked in our equity."

"Do these thoughts help you to make peace with yourself?" the girl asked, dragging along. Luna tried to stand up, and did it too fast, it seems. Everything blurred and sharp pain twisted in her side. She reflectively grasped at it. 

She felt how under her forehoof something warm trickled down her flank and leg.

Alarmed, Luna checked her dark coat. There was something [i]wrong[/i] under her skin. There was a [i]leak[/i]. She picked at it.

More hot-black splattered down on the stone floor. In a stupor, Luna turned around, while trying to maintain pressure. In a stupor of abject terror, she felt something slimy in the tear, and then pulled from it dark, gory tendrils of flesh. She sharply lurched to the wall, unable to believe what is happening. 

Her hindlegs began to slip in a growing pool of blood. "[i]I need help,[/i]" a thought came to her, cold and calculated.

Gritting her teeth, she held onto the wall and made a few shambling steps along it. Her wound seem to have stopped growing, but now strength was leaving her with every passing second.

"Somepony?" Luna called. "Somep-somebody? Someone? [i]Anyone[/i]!?"

The blackness was taking her. Her pulse defiantly drummed into her temples. She trudged on for what felt like ages, but when she glanced back, she saw that she hardly conquered a few dozens of steps.



Luna fell and writhed on the ground, barely able to breathe. "[i]Too soon. I'm not ready.[/i]"









In the darkness we can be true to ourselves. 
"Ugly and rotten, you mean?" Luna sternly objected. 
"[i]Everything[/i] rots." 
I do not have to listen to this 
Then don't.
Wait! What are you...

"M-m? Ah, here you are!" Celestia tutted. "My dear, you are a mess!"

What? Wh— Luna sputtered in disbelief and angrily grimaced.
How dare you! Do you enjoy seeing me like this!? Is [i]this[/i] why you came back!?"
How dare you!! I am the Princess of the Night! Doth this title of mine means nothing to you!? How can you treat me like this?


Her Sister was powdering herself.
Целестия мурлыкает песенку

"What are you doing!?"

"Answer me!!" Luna roared.

Celestia sighed.
What do you think?
Celestia gave her a look filled with hurt innocence, and snorted. A skin-tight masquerade mask framed her lavender eyes.

Are you kidding?
You are mocking me, right?

No, or course not, Sister dear.
I am getting ready, and you should be too.

For what, exactly?

Она открывает рот. Черви и жуки падают на пол.

Aghast, Luna shuffled back, disturbed by the image.




You never were on [i]my[/i] side!! You never listened to me! You are a fake! A mirage!

Something tugged her on the mane so hard, she almost fell.

What!? Who

"'Use your strengths to counter your weaknesses.' Do you remember this line?"

"Let go of me!"
Get off!

"Everything around you, no, everything that you ever known is someone's dream, but is there an end to your naivety? Oh-h-h, little Lulu! Are you going to complain [i]again[/i]?" the voice taunted her.

"Are you going to cry [i]again[/i]?"

"Will you come running [i]again[/i]?"



Let me kiss your eyes.

An eternity in the cold dark...

A distant surface above...

No!
She broke from the treacherous lullaby.
I don't need this! I need to [i]act[/i] now. I must.
There is still time, there is--

Она тонет,и работает 

I can't perish like this

Светлячки like falling stars.

Бредет сквозь тьму пока не находит труп Целестии снова, освещенную светлячками

She was a dead pile of flesh. A deep dark wound gaped at her chest, burned deeply. 

"What have you done to yourself?" 
"What have you done to [i]us[/i]?"
"How could you?"

"How did it all come to this?"
"How..." 
Не может остановить поток слез
"How could you..."
"You've written me out of your life, you've abandoned me, Sister!! How could you!? How could you leave me alone!! How could you rob me of my life!?"
"It is 𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝚢our 𝚏𝚊𝚞𝚕𝚝. You brought it on yourself. You 𝚍𝚎𝚜𝚎𝚛𝚟𝚎 this."

"Love is a murder of your old self... You can't go back. You [i]can't[/i]... You can't turn back the time... You can't undo the sacrifice." 

Everything peeled away, but the smile of her rotten skull remained the same.

Luna tried to force back the urge to vomit.
Плоть облезает, все гниет 
Целует Череп Целестии 
все в звенящей тишине



The proper murder always takes two. You are the only one I can rely on, Sister.

Her hand was like a raven's claw. She leaned against the 
An uncontrollable shiver quaked her feverish body. "I must be ill, but it is okay. The pain will give way to more resolve."

She reached for the stiches. She wanted to scratch them like [i]hell[/i]. "[i]I should probably stop this, though... Maybe one last time...[/i]"

She clenched the doorknob tighter, smiling to herself.
"Indulgence is for the weak. I should be better than this... Just listen to yourself, you're like an old hag."

"Are you leaving to take the scene?" 

A portrait of a woman. 


In a leather armchair

sagging in a rich leather armchair.

"You scared me," she droned with an accusing glare.

"Well, are you, Celina?" Lady Lustmord prompted.

Celina clenched her fist and buried fingernails into the palm of her hand. She moistened her lips and tried to sound more confident. "I asked you to not call me that."




It doesn't matter by what name you call yourself in those woods. They will strangle you all the same. 

Celina rubbed her neck, already feeling the cold grip.

"You will be caught by them like a fly in the cobweb," Lady's finger tapped on the desk in rhyme with next words, "that would be [i]waiting[/i] for a [i]spider[/i] to come [i]crawling[/i] in."

inside a crystal ball.

"[i]She is such an unbelievably cryptic ass,[/i]" Celina thought and winced. "You're full of horseshit. I'm going outside."

Celina slammed the door behind her, and then warily glanced at the barely familiar skyline.

Lady Lustmord didn't lie. On the branches of the gray trees were severed hands. Disturbed by the breath of the wind, they smoothly stroked across the blood-red Moon.
