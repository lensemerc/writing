An eternity in the cold dark. A distant surface above.

𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚊𝚢 𝚕𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 shone defiantly, the 𝚏𝚛𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎𝚜 glistening on ripples.

Her dark wings were heavy as lead.

Nowhere to go but down. The moonlight's rays pierced the calm around her.

The stillness. The desire to give in. She wanted to become one with the dark... she let it in. Cold burned her insides. Fear surged, the body tensed in sudden pain. She clutched herself and curled up, 𝚛𝚎𝚐𝚛𝚎𝚝𝚝𝚒𝚗𝚐.


The animal was grotesque. Something bright was falling from an obscenely long tongue of it, thrown over the fangs. When it was reaching the tip of a tongue, it was colored in red.

A being with a motherly face was helping to tuck her in. It embraced her and pulled close, leaned her head against the bared soft breast. A whisper was just above her ear: "When the fighting dies down and the quiet darkness comes, the bloodied moon shines like a bright red sun. It is a demand for a drastic change. It means that we have defiled our paradise—the very land that surrounds us."

"𝙽𝚘𝚠 𝚌𝚕𝚘𝚜𝚎 𝚢𝚘𝚞𝚛 𝚎𝚢𝚎𝚜 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑."

She goes where she pleases.

The moon was red





Love is a murder of your old self. You can't go back. You [i]can't[/i]... You can't turn back the time... You cannot undo the sacrifice.

Целует Череп Целестии


The proper murder always takes two.  "You are the only one I can rely on, Sister."


These woods will strangle you. You will be caught in them like a fly in the cobweb.
