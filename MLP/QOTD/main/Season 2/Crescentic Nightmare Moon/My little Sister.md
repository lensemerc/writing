This is my little Sister.

She can't keep up with me.

But she tries.

She tries very hard.

How carefully she follows me, dark coated and diligent...

She is a bit clumsy, and slow, and awkward.

It is a tiny bit funny, and we often laugh.

How seriously she is treated by others...

I am always faster, always stronger than her. I have no trouble doing anything. But she always tries to protect me. Sometimes it makes me sad... and other times I want to tell her, "You do not have to prove anything."

I don't think that she hears me.

She is very fragile. She worries about me. But I can take care of myself.

She is small, and she gets scared very easily. When she is scared, she holds onto my mane. So when she is scared of the dark, I keep up the nightlight. When she goes to sleep, I hold her hoof. I stand between her and the darkness.

Sometimes she is annoying. She drives me mad, really. But I always come back to her.

We laugh, play, and dream big together. One day, when she will grow up and will have adventures, I'll tell her to take care, because... she may fall, or stumble, or trip. But I will be there to pick her up from the ground and dust her off. She is my Sister. She is the best.

I wish it could always be the same. We are happy like this. We will play, and dream, and build wonders! I shall nurture her, help her grow, teach her all I know! I will be the light and warmth in her world, and she will be my best friend forever. I don't want it to change...

She is my little Sister...

I've been told

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀she was born

⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀from my dream.



I want to share with her everything.

It is 



"She is my younger sister.



She is clumsy and slow and awkward. Sometimes it's  
even funny. I can do anything easily.



I wish she could be strong like me. She can make me laugh, sometimes."



When she's scared, she holds onto my mane. I protect her from the shadows, and from the world outside. We have only each other. We dream of great things together. But sometimes a little sister grows older. I wish she could stay the same.

When we're both fillies I see her as an annoying little sister, but I love her too. She can't do anything properly, but she never gives up. And she follows me, everywhere! I don't know how can she keep up. It drives me mad sometimes, but I love her dearly. And she really wants to protect me, my little sister.

_Her eyes light up suddenly._  
"When we go to sleep in the evening, we hold hands.  
When she's scared of the dark, I turn on the nightlight.  
" _She smiles softly, with a look of immense pride._

"
I will be the light and warmth in her world,  
And she will be my best friend forever,  
My sister and my other half,  
Forever and ever and ever!"
