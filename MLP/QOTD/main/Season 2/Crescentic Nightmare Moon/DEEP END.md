An eternity in the cold dark. A distant surface above.

𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚊𝚢 𝚕𝚒𝚐𝚑𝚝 shone defiant; the 𝚏𝚛𝚊𝚌𝚝𝚞𝚛𝚎𝚜 were glistening on ripples.

Her dark wings dragged her to the depths.

The rays of moonlight were piercing the calm around her.

This stillness... This desire to give in... She wanted to become one with the dark... she let it in. Cold burned her insides. Fear surged; her body twisted in pain. She clutched herself and curled up, 𝚛𝚎𝚐𝚛𝚎𝚝𝚝𝚒𝚗𝚐.


There is a... [i]special[/i] kind of darkness at the bottom of the sea. A special eternal night.

One that requires a special leap of faith.


The animal was grotesque. Something bright kept falling from its obscenely long tongue, thrown over the fangs. When that something was reaching the tip of the tongue, it was colored in red.

A being with a motherly face helped to tuck her in. It embraced her and pulled close. It lifted her head and rested against the exposed soft breast. It whispered just above her ear, "When the fighting dies down and the quiet darkness comes, the bloodied Moon shines like a bright red Sun. Don't be deceived: it is a demand for a drastic change. It means that we have defiled our paradise—the very lands that surround us.

There was a lie that she loved to repeat to herself. 

That you can turn your suffering into strength.

Luna looked at the 

𝙷𝚎𝚛 𝚜𝚎𝚗𝚜𝚎𝚜 𝚊𝚛𝚎 𝚔𝚎𝚎𝚗 𝚗𝚘𝚠. 𝙷𝚎𝚛 𝚖𝚒𝚗𝚍 𝚠𝚊𝚜 𝚌𝚕𝚎𝚊𝚛 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚏𝚘𝚌𝚞𝚜𝚎𝚍.




As a tear was shed for who she was before, the Princess spread her wings and turned to face the darkness of the night, intending to take the most from who she was now.

Her all-seeing, god-like gaze gently moved across the peaceful realm of Equestria. From atop the Castle of Two Sisters, all the great cities laid out before her in the world of dreams, along with those who found desired solace in the embrace of night.

Thought about subjects brought a faint smile. Her love for them could only be measured by the same kind of love as that of her older sister, but truly, Luna learned the hard way—you shouldn't try to compare such a feeling as love. Such a vain and petty thing to do...

Now, as memories of her hardships steeled her resolve, she was ready once again.

She allowed herself to slip awake into the dreamrealm, into the place where the souls of living beings, just like her Moon in the sky, lay bare.

This was her realm. Not truly dark, for its darkness was full of slumbering potential. 

As dreamers' inner states unraveled before her, Princess Luna walked elegantly, looking over these sacred elysian fields. "[i]The peaceful grove, thenceforth, I am thine watchful guardian,[/i]" she thought to herself as she stepped in and out of ponies' dreams. Observing them.

They were so precious. Princess Luna adored seeing their everyday struggles and worries, and helping them to face their nightmares and fears, now and then. Only seldom in those were creeping something truly abhorrent. Their peaceful living reminded Luna about the simple and precious banalities of life.

She surfed through their inner thoughts, always in passing, never leaving an imprint large enough that her presence would intrude into their delicate inner workings. She liked being a mystery to them, but one they were familiar with, and were pulled towards.

As their collective unconsciousness shone and whispered, Luna listened to those who would suffer enough to call to her, intently or not. She wasn't going to allow anypony to feel despair or fear. This was her purpose, and her war: to let their aspirations and happiness grow while guarding them against the nightmares.

And soon enough, she discovered something sinister.

This dream was strange, filled with a sense of longing and hopelessness. As Luna touched it, she couldn't help but recoil as the contrast hit her senses.
"What tragedy befell upon thee?" she pondered aloud, as she quickly collected her thoughts, and tried to explore. Of course, nothing unusual for her. Just troubling and unexpecting.

This being suffered greatly, to the point of almost breaking. Luna called out in a quiet, yet demanding voice: "Who art thou? Speak to Us."

This time, a dimly glowing consciousness reached out to her.

This pony was dying. It filled Princess Luna with grief and hate in equal measure. She felt that it would be some unnatural, stupid cause of death. Worse of all, the pony was too young to be ill... 

There got to be some kind of mistake. Too young to even earn a cutie mark, just a filly.

Suspecting malintent behind this struggle, Luna approached, attempting to ease another's pain. Filly quickly became aware of her presence and clanged to her. Luna gently locked hooves around the pony, taking her into an embrace. Pony raised her honey-colored muzzle, full of tears and hope.

"Who dared to do this to you?" Luna demanded calmly but firmly. Her voice, full to the brim with suppressed rage, sent a ripple across the dreamscape, and close enough dreamers began to feel distressed.

"I dunno..." replied the filly, slightly shivering now, curling up.

"Please..." said Luna, far more gently now, and smiled, caressing the girl's mane. "What doth thou remember? Prithee, let me see."

She looked deep into the eyes of the filly, a gateway to her soul. The young creature gradually relented. Her mouth hung open slightly. Stars twinkled in the darkest deep of pupils.
"Ginger Lime," murmured Luna, hearing this name echoing through memories of the soul.

This filly was filled with love, promise, with longing for a future that might never come to her. It all gripped Luna's heart, but she didn't let emotions go to the head. Not until she finishes her duty.

As Luna leaned in closer, pressing foreheads with Ginger's dream-being, images of a pastoral small village flashed through her mind. The Princess beheld scenes of peaceful living, smeared in the uncertainty of vivid colors and surges of emotions. 

In these shared memories, almost nothing ever was bad. Luna saw the hard-working father and doting mother, both young enough for Ginger to be their firstborn, all of them earth ponies. Luna saw the few friends the girl made, and as it followed by happy memories, she had seen some games Ginger shared with others, as well as her hopes and dreams.

But it wasn't what the Lunar Princess was looking for. More recent trials were suppressed in overwhelming pain. Keeping caressing her, Princess carefully tried to appeal to her again.

"Who wronged you? I wish to help. I have to see this."

Ginger sobbed, slightly trembling, and then, with a trusting look, she widened her eyes. In their depth, there was a dark and damp cave passage, devoid of hope. There was a pain, as something had torn into her. Her knees were dragged across a hard, cold stone. Something binding and slimy was making it difficult to breathe. Luna heard a buzzing sound and saw small predatory insectile creatures flying towards a single gangly silhouette. And as it turned with a wicked smile, a piercing green eye looked straight at Luna as if at this very moment she had been noticed.

"Changelings," recognized the Princess of the Night.

There was no more reason to torment the girl and try to fish out of her mind a more coherent story. She needed help and immediate action. 

Luna pulled back, considering her next move. Changelings' attack happened only recently, and already they were somewhere underground. No doubt their lair wasn't far away. And with the Changeling Queen, for whatever reason, present, there is a chance to strike back hard and fast and end her menace once and for all. There might be other victims, as well...

Continuing sobs reminded her about the filly. With unease, Luna glanced down. Ginger still clanged to foreleg, unwilling to let go.
"Accept Our apology for forcing thou to relive it, Ginger Lime."

She nodded, weakly. "Please, Princess..." she kept looking, full of hope, "I'm scared. Please, please don't leave me alone!"

Luna felt her heart soften, but there was a surge of confidence as well.
"When you wake up, I will be there, little one," she said loudly, raising her head.

"You promise?"

"Yes, 'tis is Our royal promise. I will take a flight to you as fast as a roaring wind. I will make all thee nightmares go away, little one, and you will be safe."

"And my Mom and Dad? Will they be safe too?..." Ginger smiled sweetly, with relief. 

Luna wasn't sure how to react but didn't want to disappoint. She gently placed a hoof on the girl's shoulder and smiled reassuringly, knowing that she appeared powerful and regal. Just like the Princess should.
"Believe in it. Believe in me, for it will give Us strength. Everything will be alright."

[hr]

She arrived at the location merely dozens of minutes later. The little village was tucked away at the western borders of Equestria, beneath the neighboring mountain range. Luna walked between scattered little colorful houses, looking for the correct one, as night ponies landed almost silently around her. Captain of the Night Guard Onyx Star was loyally shadowing her, trying his best to be vigilant.

Ever since her return from banishment, Princess had not got around to properly training her elite guard. But then again, she didn't need them that much.

"That one," she said, and ponies scurried along to a house from Ginger's dream. The door was wide open. Few guards surrounded the perimeter, all the while Onyx Star leaned to the ground, trying to be as helpful as he could.

"There was a struggle," he noticed.

Luna nodded. They didn't even bother to cover their tracks. Staying at the open door, Luna overlooked the place in the dark. Neither she nor her subjects required any light to see. The furniture was messed up, and there were claw marks as if some feral creatures crawled around and thoroughly stirred the place.

Luna frowned.

She turned, and her gaze found Sable Song—the fastest one from the flock.

"Fly. Send word to Canterlot. We might need reinforcements from the Royal Guard, or maybe even the former Elements. Relay to Celestia, and Celestia directly, to spare no expense."

The young mare nodded and took wing immediately.

"Why bother?" cautiously asked Onyx, his ears raised in curiosity.

"We must be wary. This reeks of a trap."

"Yes, but they might also just act boldly on our borders."

"'Twould be better not to underestimate such a foe. So, if it is a trap, then for whom exactly?..."

"I'm sure that with us, they will bite off more than they can chew."

Onyx Star was too bashful for his own good, but Luna could understand this youthful eagerness. She too felt the long-forgotten tingling of the hunt.

"Come, let Us see those tracks," she said with clenched teeth. Her gaze fell on a small doll lying on the floor of the living room.

There is a job to be done.  

[hr]

Her mane fluttered in a non-existent breeze, and she could almost feel her heartbeat. Her gaze was fixed, looking for any sign of the foe. With every step, she could feel a cold fire inside, one that had been banked far, [i]far[/i] too long.  

Impressions on the dirt led towards the forest and along the stream. Something was dragged here recently. As Luna and the hunting party approached the mountains, they took a sharp turn for the woods.
Not far from there, they came to a cavernous entrance on the mountainside. Luna slid down the mound, balancing with wings, while night ponies flew overhead and took positions, wielding swords and short spears.

She glanced around, brows furrowed. "Search for other entrances, quickly."

A few ponies took off, and Luna cautiously stepped toward the cavern. Her horn shone, as she was looking for some kind of magical trap.

"Seems unguarded." Onyx Star murmured.

"True, and that is most concerning. If those foul creatures were making such a fuss, verily they would be preparing for a search party. Everypony, stand thine ground and wait for scouts. We shall proceed from there."

A few minutes came and passed in silent tense anticipation, which broke by Onyx, letting out a cry:
"Princess! There, on a mountainside!"

Luna already saw it. She squinted. There was a distant, dim flash of green magic. Luna immediately unfurled her wings, but another cry caught her attention.

"A landslide!"

Indeed, it was. Not willing to risk it, Luna got ready to take off anyway, when suddenly Onyx Star lunged forward in the darkness of a cave, and a few guards galloped along with him.

"What are you—"

"It's our only chance to find 'em, Princess!"

"Get back here!"

She needed to choose and do it fast. With a grunt, she rushed forward, the remaining ponies following suit.
A deafening rumble came from behind, and a cloud of dust and dirt rose, limiting senses. Hearing coughs all around, alicorn raised her magical horn, clearing the air in an instant.

"What [i]was[/i] that!?" She snapped at Onyx Star. He smiled sheepishly.

"Well, I was thinking, I—"

"Thou art the captain of the Night Guard. Ye all are Night Guard; ye are royal soldiers!" Luna looked around her troop, hardly believing all this, "Act the part! Don't ye realize that we played right into our enemy's hooves just now?"

"Terribly sorry. It's all my fault, mistress." Onyx looked down, displaying remorse to the best of his abilities.

Luna sighed.
"Verily so. 'Twould need for me at least an hour to clear the avalanche. Let's face our adversary. At least they might be trapped with us no less than we are with them."

Ponies bundled together, as they all walked into the dark.

Luna's eyes were as sharp as night's blade. She was beginning to anticipate the worst at this point. Her gaze periodically shifted towards Onyx Star, who was still by her side.

At least a hundred meters deep, they found themselves at the exit of a tunnel, and here, Luna made a gesture to wait. She began to slowly walk forward. Onyx stubbornly remained at her side, but this time no reprimand from the Princess followed.

Figures scurried somewhere far away in the dark, with faint buzzing noises. It was a spacious cavern and the right place for an ambush. A ledge was right above her group. Luna raised her head, trying to look convincingly focused on it, on whatever might come from there. She already heard faint sounds of the hooves...

Suddenly Onyx rushed at her, just as she expected. His spear was aimed at her side, and his muzzle was contorted in a vile grin. Luna immediately grabbed him with magic, and the changeling revealed his true form. So did a few others amidst the ponies.

A short skirmish followed between the creatures of the dark. Onyx's assault was on full display and, already tense, her troop gave no quarter.

When it ended, Luna looked at the squirming, hissing creature more closely. Its eyes were as black as the abyss, its wings and limbs long and lanky, its teeth sharp as daggers. It was spitting, zealously trying to reach her with hooves and get a hit. It was black, small, and weak.

She put a little pressure on it, and its neck snapped like a twig.

He was just [i]too[/i] eager to please his betters.

Above, there was an echoed short chuckle.

Luna raised her eyes again, looking at other creatures, arriving on the scene. A small band of changelings emerged from the shadows, and of course, their leader was in their midst. Sticking out like a sore thumb.

"Chrysalis."

The creature's grin widened in sheer amusement. Her whole look was manic, unkempt, and slightly deranged. Huge green eyes shimmered in the dark, and it wasn't helping with the overall impression, not one bit.

"Yes, it is I, [b]Queen[/b] Chrysalis, [b]Queen[/b] of the changelings! And I believe we haven't got a chance to be acquainted eye-to-eye."

"I would've preferreth it to be kept that way." Luna frowned, tossed the body of fake Onyx to the side, and then faced Chrysalis directly.

A few seconds of silence followed, interrupted only by the buzzing of new changeling drones, coming to the scene. Princess Luna and Queen Chrysalis were calmly gauging each other up. The air felt tense. Luna heard night ponies shuffling at her side as they got into position to cover her flanks, as well as the entrance to the corridor behind them.

Suddenly, Luna jerked her head forward, and Chrysalis pulled back, looking at the ceiling.

A massive scorch from a magical projectile appeared there, launched by Princess but redirected at the last second by Queen.

"Hah!" Chrysalis arrogantly scoffed. "This will be fun."

And then they clashed.

Changelings rushed down like a dark wave, but Luna paid no mind to them whatsoever. She put full faith in her subjects, now. She had to.
She made a powerful beat with great wings, spreading them and leaping above the changelings, above Chrysalis. The Queen stepped backward, anticipating.
The tip of Luna's horn shot a ray of magic across the room, narrowly missing Chrysalis. She was fast. Luna landed right where her opponent stood before, turning steadily, and launching a barrage of offensive spells.
The Queen formed a defensive shield with her magic. When it quickly shattered, she tried dodging again. A ray landed too dangerously close, forcing her onto her hind legs, making her stand still for a second, and Luna scored a direct hit into the chest.
Sent to the ground, Chrysalis gasped and growled, quickly recovering and standing up. Not letting her get a breather, Luna threw a telekinetic grip with an aura. Chrysalis' horn shone with malicious green energy as she rose, struggled, and then broke free with her magic.

"Thou still having fun, pest?" inquired the alicorn, "For me, it's not so fun. Though thou art splendid practice, I'll give you that."

Queen hissed like a snake in response.

Luna raised her tremendously powerful voice, drowning out the sounds of the battle in the Royal Speech.
"WHERE THOU ART KEEPETH THE GIRL!?"

"Is that why you’re here? It's all about lil' filly, [b]innit[/b]!?" feigned surprise Chrysalis.

"Thou art outmatched. Concede now, and I will be merciful."

"Oh no, no-no-no, NO-no-no-no~" she spoke in a fast, intense, echoing voice, grinning madly, as she was backing away. Her trembling horn was pointed straight at Luna, "'It would not be [b]that[/b] simple, Princess!"

"I say 'twould. We have hunted scum like you since time immemorial," boasted Luna. "Ye, [i]bugs[/i], are a far cry from the threats that Us had faced before. Know thy place!"

Her eyes shone with terrible white, and lightning stroked down from her horn. Sizzling and crackling with magical energy, it almost reached the Queen. From the wall impact, a fountain of sharp debris stroke the changeling. Chrysalis turned to flee. Luna hounded her, following.

They galloped in a chase through the dark caves. The Queen was slightly faster, and it troubled Luna. As changelings knew their lair far better, in the worst case, this battle now could go on for days.

It needed to be stopped now.

They reached a large tunnel brimming with gleaming, colored crystals. The Queen flew in the air, laughing maniacally. The Princess followed, and her powerful wings carried her forward with great speed. Crystals surrounded them both now, and the Princess noticed dangerous protruding edges.

Chrysalis turned mid-flight, launching a magical attack. Luna was ready. She folded her wings and swayed to the side, almost tearing her stomach on sharp crystals. The ray passed close by and scorched her back. Her retaliation attack struck Chrysalis in the chest once more.

Startingly resilient, the Changeling Queen fell backward on the far side of the cavern, at the safe spot, where the tunnel extended into the normal one. She stood up immediately, her eyes bewildered, her wounds steaming. She staggered, retreating once again.

"Concede," the alicorn simply repeated, with calm power in her voice.

She landed before the changeling with an audible "thump" of her hooves. Her head was raised. She walked forward, and then—

[i]Pain.[/i]

Some magical contraption revealed itself beneath her, and something resembling electricity surged greedily through her body.

Luna gritted her teeth, combating this magic, hearing how Chrysalis was giving out the most raucous noblemare laughter she can muster.

"You all-powerful, [b]foolish[/b] mare! You just keep walking right into my traps!"
She chuckled cruelly, looking at Luna's agony, taking it all in.
"I just can't fathom that [b]you[/b] were Nightmare Moon. Look at yourself [b]now[/b]. Some [b]second-rate[/b], worthless [b]waste[/b] of space."

Luna growled, collecting herself, holding straight her intense gaze. Chrysalis' smile slowly receded.

The alicorn stepped forward, ruining the edge of the magic circle underneath. It immediately sizzled out of energy.

"I have no fear of you. Thou art the wielder of tricks, and nothing more. What you cannot truly fathom, is the power of the Princess of the Night. Cease thee fruitless resistance."

Luna was still holding back, fearing the danger of bringing down the whole cavern system, and she suspected Chrysalis knew it. The Changeling Queen, on her end, was going all-in with this ploy of hers. She was gambling even her life, it was clear as crystal. Luna wondered just how far her opponent would go this time.

"So what?"
Chrysalis' voice was seeping venom. She backed into the dark cave.

Luna followed, ready for anything, listening to an unhinged echoing voice.

"Am I to tremble in [b]awe[/b] before your presence?" Chrysalis arrogantly sneered, "Am I to worship you now? Am I to [b]surrender[/b] all that I am, and cease existing? What, you want to blink me away like I am some afterthought? Deny me my strife? I [b]refuse[/b] you all!"

As if a command was given, more changeling drones dropped at the Princess from the ceiling.

Luna allowed some Dark magic into her heart.
Just a speck, enough for them to learn how to submit.

She reared and raised the horn, beaming black energy, and most of the attackers fell immediately. Those who remained pulled back. If there was at least some self-preservation in their minds, it should've overruled hunger and obedience to the Queen by now.

Luna didn't allow them to comprehend the new emotion of dread. Snarling, she gripped them all with aura and launched them at the Queen, as mere projectiles. The impact on the wall caused their bodies to scatter. They fell, broken and mangled, and as the Princess was walking forward, she stepped on some straggler, crushing its head with full weight. A dark, watery substance popped from the bug and splattered all over the floor.

The Queen had already fled into the shadowy tunnels. Princess pursued once more, her form became intangible. She summoned her power and flew through the air, reaching Chrysalis in seconds and cutting her off.

The changeling glared with searing hate. Luna's eyes were milk-white. She stepped closer, willing to keep on chasing, but Chrysalis seemed to understand that running was pointless.

"Wherever thou goest, thou bringest only suffering, Chrysalis."

The Queen scoffed.
"Tell me something I [b]didn't[/b] know. Your point?"

"Thy question was, why thine strife is unwelcome. That is why."

"Ah..."

The Changeling Queen cocked her head to the side, in amusement. Chuckled with a menacing look.

Chuckled again.

Then she roared with sinister laughter, flashing her fangs in a toothy grin.

She took a step closer, showing no fear before the Lunar Princess. 
"So that means... You would wish for a world without strife, then?..."
Her voice, as she spoke, had a strangely calm and gentle hue to it, vividly contrasting with her demeanor.

Nonetheless, the Princess frowned, immutable. She braced herself for some monologue, and Chrysalis delivered.

"You wish for a safe, perfect, little haven, where everypony is so courteously bowing to one another like they are in the hooves of some annoying little brats. 'Oh, would you like tea?' 'Sure, did you see my dress?' 'This stallion is so amazing, he smiled at me!'... How utterly pathetically [b]dull[/b]. Someone will always suffer. Don't you understand this simple idea? So why am I, [b]Queen[/b] Chrysalis, not worth to be existing in [b]your[/b] world!?" The Changeling Queen hissed in righteous anger. "Why would I, the one with the ability and power to change, need to live under [b]your[/b] rules!?! Bend to [b]your[/b] whim!?"

Sad thing, Luna had understood Chrysalis, but just couldn't stomach the attitude. She smirked to herself, "[i]Oh, I'll give you strife.[/i]"
"Thou art a foul excuse for a Queen, in name only! Just look at thyself, what do you even know about the ruling? Thou art just a mongrel, a beast, thou even don't have subjects per se, just some mindless weaklings who stumble at every task, and listen to you because of fear!"

"I provide them with [b]love[/b] to feed!" Chrysalis snarled defensively, "What would [b]you[/b] even know about [b]my[/b] Hive, and [b]my[/b] rule!? In fact, when have [b]you[/b] ever done anything substantial for your little moronic ponies? What do you even do, prance around in their dreams, deal with their problems? Wench, you were banished for a [b]thousand years[/b], and somehow they were just [b]fine[/b]. They were even [b]better[/b] than now, I reckon!"

Luna snorted. 
"You know nothing about what you speak of! And why would you? Thou art a bully, a lowlife pest, festering in the world. And besides, no wonder you have to [i]steal[/i] love. No one would ever look at thine pathetic, scrawny, bug-like visage, and be  earnestly in love you!"

Suddenly Chrysalis, already on the edge, charged forward. Luna, ready for a magic duel, was completely caught unaware by a headbutt straight in the face.
Green magic pulsated in every direction from the impact. Luna felt blood, for the first time in centuries. Her eyes widened, muzzle went numb. Luna stumbled for a moment but then punched a hoof back into Chrysalis' own muzzle.
The Queen groaned in pain. She attempted to slash Luna's throat with a jagged hoof, but it only scratched her coat. Luna, absolutely livid, gripped her mane, and Queen did the same. They began to try to overpower each other; it was no longer a fight, just some visceral brawl.

It appeared that bug-Queen was much more lightweight and weaker than a true-born alicorn. Luna dragged Queen under and pummeled her in the chest. Chitin cracked, and Queen grunted in pain, now sprawled on the floor.

In her eyes there was fear, and it pleased Luna immensely. The Queen's fragile wings fluttered against the stone beneath.

Luna swiftly raised her front hooves to bring them down on Chrysalis head. The Queen squirmed, wormed out from the Princess, barely avoiding. She immediately took off flying. Luna grabbed her with magic mid-flight and smashed against the rocky wall. Chrysalis screamed and fell.

Princess's horn flared up with moonlight, ready to deliver the final blow.

There was sudden hissing to the side. More changeling drones blindsided Princess while she was distracted. They threw themselves at her back and began biting like a pack of small, vicious predators. Luna used stored magic power to project a barrier, strong enough to propel them away and take them out.

She looked around. Chrysalis was already limping away, slowly gaining speed. More changelings tried to protect their Queen, their little horns flared with magic. Last of their forces, Luna was sure of it.

As Luna charged them, Chrysalis was heard, howling her toothless threats:
"You will pay for your insolence! My minions will rip your head clean off and dance with it! They will bring your head to me as a trophy, along with your limbs!"

The spells of the drones only grazed her, and Luna didn't paid them much attention, taking them out in a single powerful blast. She walked straight through the smoke and scorched bodies to the Queen, who, to her credit, wasn't trying to cower. Instead, she snarled wickedly, facing Princess head-on in her last bout of defiance.
"I am not a lowlife. Not a pest. Not a bug. I am the [b]Queen[/b] OF ALL [i]Change[/i]—"

Luna swiftly turned, bucking Chrysalis straight in the head. With a sickening wet sound, the bug-Queen fell at the nearby wall, leaving a dark bloody smear on it. Her body gone limp.

Lunar Princess adjusted her celestial mane with a hoof. Then she touched the muzzle, concerned, feeling a broken nose.

"I will not stand for it," she frowned, looking around. Her eyes widened. The body of the felled Queen was no longer in its place.

"CHRYSALIS!" she roared in Royal Voice, her magic flaring up once more. Suddenly, a snake-like creature struck her from below, quickly coiling around the Princess' torso, catching her off guard. It sank teeth deep into her neck.

"ENOUGH."

With effort, Luna spread her wings apart, and it threw the constrictor off. As it hit the ground, it reverted to the form of the Queen. She slowly stood up, trembling, looking with stubborn hate, breathing heavily.

"GIRL!" hoarsely demanded Luna. Her horn shone with terrible light and gripped Chrysalis' neck with magic. She gave out a panicked gasp and then went still.

"Where. Is. GIRL?" the Princess put some expression into her thundering voice, and finally, Chrysalis relented.

"There," she responded weakly, pointing her holey hoof to one of the tunnels. Princess immediately began to walk, dragging the changeling along.

[hr]

They took a few twisted passages and turns. Luna wrapped the beaten Queen in a bind, not allowing her to speak or move. A few simple conjurations were enough to stuff a magical sock down her throat and pull another over her horn. Those spells already came in handy on cold nights.

Eventually, the path took them to the wide cavern. It was illuminated by dim moonlight, reaching through crevices and small openings. Overlooking a huge clearing in front of them, with uneven rocks laying around, Luna saw captured night ponies in the middle, covered with slime. Then her eyes were drawn to something at the far wall.

There she saw the missing ponies from the village, all three were sharing same cocoon. Luna looked closer and felt her heart sink.

Ginger Lime's parents were dead, drained of all life.

She had no doubts about it. Their thin and shriveled, colorless forms were embracing their little daughter, who was sleeping with a content smile in middle of this grotesque display.

Luna glared at Chrysalis, the monster who did all of it.

"Thou hast gone too far. We and Celestia shall determine thine fate in the Royal Palace, but I will say now: to the Tartarus with thee!"

She flattened the Queen with magic until a labored grunt of pain was heard.

Leaving Chrysalis lying breathless and like a worthless sack, Luna walked forward in anger to check up on the guards. They were turning to her, and she saw their wide eyes and looks of urgency. She tore slime from the mouth of the nearest one.

He gasped, pleading:
"Princess, be careful!"

And then, the changelings played their final move.

Unassuming rocks around the perimeter burned green, revealing them to be drones. Luna turned, ready to battle, but they pushed their horns to the ground instead, and sudden purple energy rushed in tricky patterns toward the center of the room.

The alicorn understood what was going on a second too late. Purple-colored magic entwined and then rose from the ground, forming a dome above her and the ponies. A potent barrier, prepared in advance.

Changelings remained in place, their heads held down. A grim realization came: they are living anchors for this trap.

Luna launched an attack on the dome. Her magic did not even left a mark. She let out an exasperated sigh, pacing the ground. 

Before her eyes, the Queen slowly rose from her spot, shedding dispelled magic like an eggshell. She laughed victoriously.
No noise reached Luna from behind the barrier.

Amusingly, Chrysalis was completely oblivious to that. She launched into a long-winded speech, no doubt gloating. Her mangy form was jerking from side to side. Luna saw passionate gesturing as Chrysalis arrogantly gave her enemies smug and triumphant side glances.

Not bothering with watching the spectacle, the Princess swiftly freed the remaining soldiers. There was a sizable lot, including those that came into caverns with her. A particular familiar face came to her attention.
"Onyx Star? Here you are."

"Your Majesty." Malnourished and beaten, he managed a bow.

"Report to Us, Captain."

"Changelings captured me and my unit at least a few days ago... Queen Chrysalis herself was interrogating on topics related to defenses of the realm..." he hesitated, "In particular, she wanted to know more about you, Princess."

"So much planning, all of a sudden," Luna raspily murmured, looking at Chrysalis, who was still completely immersed in her little world. "I wonder..."

Princess tried to slip into the dreamrealm, but her horn just fruitlessly sizzled. No contact with anything on another side, then. Luna looked thoroughly at the bug monsters, struggling to keep the barrier. At least a few dozen were working just to keep her down in this place.

So she will need to wait, then.

She waited much longer before.

Despite her bruises, she tried to appear regal to her loyal soldiers, slightly lifting a hoof and looking at them sternly.
"Have faith and be vigilant, subjects. Celestia, or others, shall come to our aid on the morrow. These abhorrent actions won't go unpunished! That is Our royal promise."

As she was finishing this short and powerful speech, she watched as little Ginger slowly opened her eyes.
