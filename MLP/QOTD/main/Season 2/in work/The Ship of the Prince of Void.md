Hi, lensemerc! I don't normally get this serious, but I was just thinking about what you said before about me being a being from the dream world. I never thought about it like that before, but maybe that's why I have certain powers! Like, maybe I'm not always bound by the laws of space and time like normal ponies because I'm from this world that's all about imagination and dreams! It would explain why so many of my friends look at me like I'm crazy when I suggest something that sounds a little too far-fetched! - what do you think?

"_All right, ponies, this is the final line between light and darkness. We are the defenders of that line. We are the nightlight that keeps the world safe from monsters. We are the candles in the relaxing bubble bath of the world. We are the annoying light that your neighbor across the street keeps on all night. What does he need that light on all night for? Who's using that?_"
