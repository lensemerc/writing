Princess Amore was dead, and everything became worse.

Сцена: Целестия и Луна находят её тело.
What did he done to her?

Пони, Драконы, Ночные пони и Грифоны сражаются против Кристал Эмпаир

Селестия не выражает особых эмоций когда видит убитую Амору.



One of the sculptures has a pony operate a bow and arrow with hooves, rather than like we saw in **Equestria Games.**

“The Empire’s magic is powerful. It cannot fall again, my sister.” Luna’s statement clearly implies that Crystal Empire under Sombra is a threat all by itself. See also “Even my knowledge of the Empire is limited. But what I do know is that it contains a powerful magic.”

Don't touch that! 

- “She will succeed at her task. And when she does, we’ll know that she is that much closer to being ready.” I wonder if any interesting interpretations based on assuming that “she” is Cadance, rather than Twilight, exist.
- The whole presentation involves a crystal, which Celestia keeps under a glass dome. The actual significance of that object is not explained.

Vae victus.

Луна щадит Сомбру и позволяет ему сбежать
Banishment

As a shadow he is nearly powerless.

Селестия яростна
Is is our duty!

Celestia:
It will pass.

Celestia:
They feel the weakness. Don't show it.

Целестия запечатала Сердце в столице.

There will be a test... 
Un unlikely hero will come

A hero of the Crystal Empire will come and prove his abilities of wielding the Dark, as well as using it for 




We can't rely on the Crystal Heart forever, Sister.


Besides. You know what can happen when it is misused.

Luna's ears fell down. "Are you angry with me?"

I am sorry. I haven't meant to offend.

The Crystal Princess fell

Сцена: Целестия выходит из Crystal Mirror
I was surveying it. He had found no reflection in the mirror world.

Which means?

He's become fully of darkness, Luna. 

Солдатам: Move the Crystal Mirror beyond the premises of the city.

Луна украла Кристал Харт у Сомбры, и Целестия запечатывает его в измерении

Кристал Харт был уничтожен Сомброй, но Целестия чинит его тут же

"I've stolen his Dark Heart,"

"It isn't his Dark Heart. This relic was called Crystal Heart, and it serves as amplifier,"

Is everything ready for the ritual?


Сомбра Старсвирлу:
"You are a fool, old mage, even if you was a wise teacher."


Целестия Сомбре:
"You've lost. Everything that you wanted to achieve is now beyond your reach. Surrender now."


"Surrender?" The unicorn replied, looking down on half-destroyed landscape.

"There's still ponies at your side who believe in your cause, however misguided it may be. "



"No, Sun demigoddess," Sombra raised his red eyes, in which lied deep-seated hate, "I refuse to surrender."

Они пытаются использовать Элементы Гармонии, но у Луны не получается. Тогда они уничтожают Сомбру двойным лучом

"I've seen the heart of your dream-sister, Celestia." 

Пилларсы сражаются против Сомбры. Стигиан вырублен.
