Аморе (Кризалис в облике Аморе) обещает научить Каданс владеть магией любви

Фальшивая Аморе говорит с Каданс на балконе о природе Любви

Что ты думаешь о романтической любви?

You know, maybe love sometimes is just when the lid on toilet is lowered.


I think romantic love defines itself by conflict. That includes what happens after vows are said, and the pair goes on to settle in. It is a constant movement toward the light of another soul, trying to find solace in it, in caring about others' wellbeing, and yet it is so much more...

"I know about that. I am happily married," Cadance replied with a pang of sadness. Was Princess Amore ever engaged with anyone? 

"Then you must understand. It is a compulsion, yes, and it is a power. You might say that everyone is constantly in love with something—sometimes with feelings and concepts, not with people. Love is the essence that fuels our existence, gives us purpose, our actions meaning. It transcends mere infatuation and extends to a deep connection with the world around us. Without love, life would be devoid of passion and vitality, leaving us empty and disconnected from our own equinity. And yet," Amore smirked wanily, "at the same time it is a driving, destructive force. Sometimes it is not gentle. Not at all."

"Love is a consuming [b]power[/b], right... And yet all those sentiments are a distraction, for one consumed by it they can be weak, susceptible to being used. Love is a selfish act, and through that selfishness, all involved suffer. It can be both the greatest strength and the most dangerous of flaws. For the unwise, it is all the reason to guard your heart, not becoming slave to your emotions and passions."

True love is a lie. We pretend to care for another, when it is we who seek the comfort that another provides us. 

I want your every act to be filled with love, girl. Do you understand?

I cannot respect love, when it is a lie. That there are two versions, a true version and an accepted lie, is perhaps it's own commentary on its value in society."

"A wise observation, if somewhat sentimental in its outlook. But love does indeed shape our existence, giving it purpose and direction.  It can bring out the best and worst in us, and it can define our very being. It is for that reason that we must guard our hearts, lest we allow ourselves to become slaves to our emotions, or worse, turn to hate and destruction."

That kind of strong love is enough

"Sometimes love fills you with so much, you just have to [b]share.[/b]"

Cadance tensed up.

"Don't struggle." The creature leaned to her closer, and in her smile, there were fangs, "I will have what I [b]want.[/b]"
