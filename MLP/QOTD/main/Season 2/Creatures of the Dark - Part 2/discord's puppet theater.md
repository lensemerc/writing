Hey, Cadey?
Cadance (in process of changing Flurry's diapers) Look, we're basically all gods, right? Who's to judge us?

Live is universal, baby. Everyone can love everyone, we're no bigots.


"I can see, you are not going to surrender... Well then, the time for lovemaking is **over**, and the time for slaughter is **now**!"

Creepy.


Celestia: "I can fix her... "

Chrysalis: "No, I can fix you."


"Pathetic."

"No, you pathetic."

"No, you!"

"You!"

"...Shit. That's hot."

"Of course that's hot! Have you seen me? I am the hottest thing there is! I am THE SUN!"




Luna: No one would ever love you!
Chrysalis: GOD, you're piss me off... So, your sister available?
Luna: Whatever do you mean?
Chrysalis: Ballin'. I will seduce her out of SPITE


Behold! Power of the protagonist, most magnificent power in the world!

Celestia: I'm screwed.

Chrysalis: You can say [i]that[/i] again.

Whoosh! Whee! Puh-pah-pam!
