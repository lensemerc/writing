Hey, Cadey?
Cadance (in process of changing Flurry's diapers) Look, we're basically all gods, right? Who's to judge us?

Live is universal, baby. Everyone can love everyone, we're no bigots.



Celestia: "I can fix her... "

Chrysalis: "No, I can fix you."




Luna: No one would ever love you!
Chrysalis: GOD, you're piss me off... So, your sister available?
Luna: Whatever do you mean?
Chrysalis: Ballin'. I will seduce her out of SPITE


Behold! Power of the protagonist, most magnificent power in the world!

Chrysalis: You can say [i]that[/i] again.

Whoosh! Whee! Puh-pah-pam!
