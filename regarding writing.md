A bad sadfic says, "Hey, remember this thing? It was sad, wasn't it? You should be sad now!" A good sadfic, like this one, says, "Hey, here's why this thing was sad. Here's what it meant to the characters. Draw your own conclusions."

1. [20:20]Estee: Well... there's house jokes about the 'style'. Namely, run off at the keyboard, live in the white space, have characters talk around the actual issue, never be afraid to toss a () anywhere, and don't forget to repeat a key line somewhere!
2. 
    [20:22]Kirtai: Lots of negative space too

    [editing] has the effect of imposing order on images constantly in motion, imposing order on chaos. The end of all this is indeed a kind of beauty, a beauty of controlled motion, more like dancing than painting ... His films move at a breathtaking clip: dynamic, driving, taut, at their extreme even hysterical; the unrelenting, frantic acceleration of pace seems to spring from the release of some tremendous accumulation of pressure. What you need is what the scene is about, who does what to whom, and who cares about whom ... All I want is a master scene and I'll take care of the restâ€”how to shoot it, how to keep the machinery out of the way, and how to focus attention on the actors at all times.

    @Estee Her slow trot paused, just long enough for her left hind hoof to lightly tap against the cobblestones three times. The precisely-styled tail curled in twice, covered her mark on each side before going back to its standard loft. How much did you study equines? XD

    As necessary, depending on the story.
    
3. ### _[_21:57_]_Estee_:_Â 
    
    I've had to research behaviors, movement range, effects of various plants in the diet... all sorts of little things.
    
4. ### _[_21:58_]_Estee_:_Â 
    
    If you're asking 'Have I taken a formal course?' No.
    
5. ### _[_21:58_]_Estee_:_Â 
    
    I've also never lived with horses.
    
6. ### _[_21:58_]_Estee_:_Â 
    
    I _have_ ridden.
    
7. ### _[_21:59_]_Forcalor_:_Â 
    
    Need to lean into that for further writing, are there any good sources to dig in? Making references to the fact that characters are equines is highly amusing
    
8. ### _[_22:00_]_Estee_:_Â 
    
    I haven't found any central site.

    _nods_ Still you have it down well on body language
    

11. ### _[_22:00_]_Estee_:_Â 
    
    Lots of little ones, plus a dose of vet journals.
        
12. ### _[_22:00_]_Snowy Haze_:_Â 
    
    But the triple hoof tap was it thoughtfulness or nerves? Horses do both in both cases
    
13. ### _[_22:01_]_Estee_:_Â 
    
    It'll be later in the story, Snowy. That's all I can say for now.

    Ah alrighty ![ðŸ™‚](https://discord.com/assets/da3651e59d6006dfa5fa07ec3102d1f3.svg)

    Sorry just enjoying your effort
    
16. ### _[_22:02_]_Estee_:_Â 
    
    The vet journals are especially good for checking into food issues and things like 'rain rot'.
    
17. ### _[_22:02_]_Estee_:_Â 
    
    That last was a surprise...
